If so, your most common question has been, \"When is Season Two coming out?\" Or in many cases, it hasn't been a question, it's been more like, \"GIVE ME SEASON TWO NOW!\" Well, the wait is over. Launching with a huge global livestream Easter Sunday at 8pm ET (important details below), Season Two is here.\n\nHaven't seen The Chosen? Don't watch this trailer! We encourage you to catch up on Season One fast, because we can't promise the millions who will watch Season Two won't reveal spoilers. So stop what you're doing and go \"binge Jesus,\" as we like to say.\n\n\"How do I watch The Chosen?\" Good question. It's free and easy. Yes, free...doesn't even require an email address. Look up \"The Chosen\" wherever you get your phone apps, download it, and then you can freely and easily connect it directly from there to your streaming device (Apple TV, Firestick, Roku, Chromecast). Don't have a streaming device? Probably time to get one.\n\n\"Wait, free and easy? How is that possible?\" Again, good question. We happen to be the #1 highest crowd-funded media project of all time, which means we've done this completely outside the system. We built our own app, we've sold our own DVDs, and instead of requiring payment to watch, we offer you the chance to \"pay it forward\" so we can continue to keep it free and also produce future seasons. But you don't have to. Seriously.\n\nWe're watched in literally every country in the world, we've been translated into over 50 languages, and we've heard from literally millions of people that getting to know the authentic Jesus has changed their life.\n\nSeason Two launches Easter Sunday, 8:00pm ET, with a huge global livestream on our FB & Youtube channels and \"The Chosen\" app, and from then on, it'll be available forever.\n\nWelcome to The Chosen.
