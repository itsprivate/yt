And then there are the details: The family pictures in the Oval Office. What rugs will the Bidens want in their living quarters? What color curtains will they have? Where and how will President Biden store his mail?\n\nThe new commander in chief is getting a lot of correspondence already. Perhaps surprisingly, outgoing President Donald Trump left a note for the new chief executive. Maybe even more surprisingly, Biden said,\n\n\"The president wrote a very generous letter.\"\n\nThere's also the letter that Amazon sent to the newly inaugurated president, offering to assist with upcoming COVID vaccination drives. And there's the \"private message\" that Queen Elizabeth sent to Biden ahead of his January 20th inauguration, The Sunday Times reported. \n\nBiden has received messages from many of the world's leaders, as they offer their congratulations and their hope for a path forward in U.S. foreign policy. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in an interview with Sky News, said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a, quote, \"joint united agenda\" and that the new administration was \"a fantastic thing for America.\" Was the queen's message similar, perhaps?\n\nVanity Fair says that Queen Elizabeth's letter will remain as private as President Trump's letter to Biden presumably will. While we can't guess as to the content of the letter, we can bet that it was personalized. Joe Biden is the 14th president to lead the U.S. during Queen Elizabeth's reign. And, considering her history with the other 13 sitting U.S. presidents, it's certain that the two will meet in the next four years. Perhaps the message extended an invitation to Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.\n\nOr is it possible Joe and Jill Biden could pass the Balmoral Test? That's a very tentative maybe. According to Time, Queen Elizabeth has met with every U.S. president, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson, since she became queen in February 1952. In that time, only President Eisenhower was invited to her summer home of Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nThis being said, Her Majesty is said to have been quite charmed by Barack Obama. Author Tom Quinn, who wrote Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle, claims the queen developed a soft spot for America after meeting the 44th president. If that's the case, perhaps Queen Elizabeth associates President Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, with his old boss, which can only be good. Over eight years, the Obamas visited with the queen three times.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth began her reign, Harry S. Truman was president of the United States. The two had actually met a few months before, in October 1951, when the queen was still a princess. In addition to sitting U.S. presidents, The Heritage Foundation notes that Her Majesty also met President Herbert Hoover, who was in office from 1929 to 1933, prior to becoming queen.\n\nThe Independent notes that Queen Elizabeth and President Joe Biden have not yet met, though some outlets report otherwise. It's possible they exchanged pleasantries during Biden's 36 years in the U.S. Senate, but while serving as vice president from 2009 to 2017, Biden did not travel with the Obamas on their three state visits to the U.K., and the queen last visited the United States in 2007, then the guest of President George W. Bush and Laura Bush. \n\nGiven all the rich history the queen has with America's leaders, it's not hard to imagine that her private message to President Biden was one of cordial friendship — even if the two have yet to meet. With COVID-19 restrictions still firmly in place around the world, a visit between Queen Elizabeth and the 46th U.S. president will no doubt be delayed, but it will happen. It's tradition, after all. \n\n#QueenElizabeth #JoeBiden #Inauguration\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/317367/heres-how-queen-elizabeth-responded-to-bidens-inauguration/","slug":"/youtube/WdVWba0VEkA","title":"Here's How Queen Elizabeth Responded To Biden's Inauguration","date":"January 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"伊丽莎白女王如何回应拜登的就职典礼？","description":"尽管环境肯定很熟悉，但乔-拜登总统和第一夫人吉尔-拜登肯定还在适应真正住进白宫的新居。\n\n有一些大事情要处理，比如堆积如山的行政命令。还有一些细节。椭圆形办公室的全家福 比登夫妇想要在他们的住处铺上什么地毯？他们会有什么颜色的窗帘？拜登总统将在哪里以及如何存放他的邮件？\n\n新任总司令已经收到了大量的信件。也许令人惊讶的是，即将离任的总统唐纳德-特朗普给新任首席执行官留下了一张纸条。也许更令人惊讶的是，拜登说：\n\n\"总统写了一封非常慷慨的信。\"\n\n还有亚马逊给新上任总统的信，表示愿意协助即将到来的COVID疫苗接种活动。还有据《星期日泰晤士报》报道，伊丽莎白女王在拜登1月20日就职前给拜登发的 \"私信\"。\n\n拜登已经收到了许多世界各国领导人的信息，他们对美国外交政策的前进道路表示祝贺和希望。英国首相鲍里斯-约翰逊（Boris Johnson）在接受天空新闻采访时表示，美国和英国拥有一个，引用一句话，\"共同的团结议程\"，新政府 \"对美国来说是一件奇妙的事情\"。女王的信息或许也是类似的吗？\n\n名利场》称，伊丽莎白女王的信将保持私密性，就像特朗普总统给拜登的信大概会一样。虽然我们无法猜测信的内容，但我们可以打赌，这封信是个性化的。乔-拜登是伊丽莎白女王在位期间领导美国的第14位总统。而且，考虑到她与其他13位美国现任总统的历史，可以肯定的是，两人将在未来4年内会面。也许消息中向白金汉宫或温莎城堡发出了邀请。\n\n或者说，乔和吉尔-拜登有可能通过巴尔莫拉尔测试？这是个很试探性的可能。据《时代》周刊报道，自1952年2月伊丽莎白女王成为女王以来，除了林登-B-约翰逊之外，她已经会见了每一位美国总统。在这期间，只有艾森豪威尔总统被邀请到她位于苏格兰的夏季别墅巴尔莫勒尔城堡。\n\n话说回来，据说女王陛下对奥巴马颇有好感。作家汤姆-奎恩，曾写过《肯辛顿宫。从玛丽女王到梅根・马克尔的亲密回忆录》的作者汤姆・奎恩称 女王在见到第44任总统后对美国产生了好感。如果真是这样，也许伊丽莎白女王会联想到奥巴马总统的前副总统乔-拜登和他的老上司，这只能是好事。8年时间里，奥巴马夫妇曾三次拜访女王。\n\n伊丽莎白女王开始执政时，哈里-杜鲁门是美国总统。其实两人在几个月前，也就是1951年10月就见过了，当时女王还是公主。除了在任的美国总统，《传统基金会》指出，女王陛下在成为女王之前，还见过1929年至1933年在任的赫伯特-胡佛总统。\n\n独立报》指出，伊丽莎白女王和乔-拜登总统还没有见过面，不过有的媒体报道不是这样。他们有可能在拜登在美国参议院任职的36年期间进行过寒暄，但在2009年至2017年担任副总统期间，拜登并没有与奥巴马夫妇一起对英国进行三次国事访问，而女王上一次访问美国是在2007年，当时是乔治-W-布什总统和劳拉-布什的客人。\n\n鉴于女王与美国领导人有着丰富的历史，不难想象她给拜登总统的私信是一种亲切的友谊--即使两人尚未见面。由于COVID-19的限制措施仍在全球范围内坚定不移地实施，伊丽莎白女王和第46任美国总统之间的访问无疑会被推迟，但它会发生。这毕竟是传统。\n\n#伊丽莎白女王#乔-拜登#就职典礼。\n\n阅读全文：https://www.thelist.com/317367/heres-how-queen-elizabeth-responded-to-bidens-inauguration/","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伊麗莎白女王如何迴應拜登的就職典禮？","description":"儘管環境肯定很熟悉，但喬-拜登總統和第一夫人吉爾-拜登肯定還在適應真正住進白宮的新居。\n\n有一些大事情要處理，比如堆積如山的行政命令。還有一些細節。橢圓形辦公室的全家福 比登夫婦想要在他們的住處鋪上什麼地毯？他們會有什麼顏色的窗簾？拜登總統將在哪裏以及如何存放他的郵件？\n\n新任總司令已經收到了大量的信件。也許令人驚訝的是，即將離任的總統唐納德-特朗普給新任首席執行官留下了一張紙條。也許更令人驚訝的是，拜登說：\n\n\"總統寫了一封非常慷慨的信。\"\n\n還有亞馬遜給新上任總統的信，表示願意協助即將到來的COVID疫苗接種活動。還有據《星期日泰晤士報》報道，伊麗莎白女王在拜登1月20日就職前給拜登發的 \"私信\"。\n\n拜登已經收到了許多世界各國領導人的信息，他們對美國外交政策的前進道路表示祝賀和希望。英國首相鮑里斯-約翰遜（Boris Johnson）在接受天空新聞採訪時表示，美國和英國擁有一個，引用一句話，\"共同的團結議程\"，新政府 \"對美國來說是一件奇妙的事情\"。女王的信息或許也是類似的嗎？\n\n名利場》稱，伊麗莎白女王的信將保持私密性，就像特朗普總統給拜登的信大概會一樣。雖然我們無法猜測信的內容，但我們可以打賭，這封信是個性化的。喬-拜登是伊麗莎白女王在位期間領導美國的第14位總統。而且，考慮到她與其他13位美國現任總統的歷史，可以肯定的是，兩人將在未來4年內會面。也許消息中向白金漢宮或溫莎城堡發出了邀請。\n\n或者說，喬和吉爾-拜登有可能通過巴爾莫拉爾測試？這是個很試探性的可能。據《時代》週刊報道，自1952年2月伊麗莎白女王成爲女王以來，除了林登-B-約翰遜之外，她已經會見了每一位美國總統。在這期間，只有艾森豪威爾總統被邀請到她位於蘇格蘭的夏季別墅巴爾莫勒爾城堡。\n\n話說回來，據說女王陛下對奧巴馬頗有好感。作家湯姆-奎恩，曾寫過《肯辛頓宮。從瑪麗女王到梅根・馬克爾的親密回憶錄》的作者湯姆・奎恩稱 女王在見到第44任總統後對美國產生了好感。如果真是這樣，也許伊麗莎白女王會聯想到奧巴馬總統的前副總統喬-拜登和他的老上司，這隻能是好事。8年時間裏，奧巴馬伕婦曾三次拜訪女王。\n\n伊麗莎白女王開始執政時，哈里-杜魯門是美國總統。其實兩人在幾個月前，也就是1951年10月就見過了，當時女王還是公主。除了在任的美國總統，《傳統基金會》指出，女王陛下在成爲女王之前，還見過1929年至1933年在任的赫伯特-胡佛總統。\n\n獨立報》指出，伊麗莎白女王和喬-拜登總統還沒有見過面，不過有的媒體報道不是這樣。他們有可能在拜登在美國參議院任職的36年期間進行過寒暄，但在2009年至2017年擔任副總統期間，拜登並沒有與奧巴馬伕婦一起對英國進行三次國事訪問，而女王上一次訪問美國是在2007年，當時是喬治-W-布什總統和勞拉-布什的客人。\n\n鑑於女王與美國領導人有着豐富的歷史，不難想象她給拜登總統的私信是一種親切的友誼--即使兩人尚未見面。由於COVID-19的限制措施仍在全球範圍內堅定不移地實施，伊麗莎白女王和第46任美國總統之間的訪問無疑會被推遲，但它會發生。這畢竟是傳統。\n\n#伊麗莎白女王#喬-拜登#就職典禮。\n\n閱讀全文：https://www.thelist.com/317367/heres-how-queen-elizabeth-responded-to-bidens-inauguration/","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-cc688083-8dcb-5d4c-aa74-6f0b8532745e","excerpt":"Download NOW!! ►► https://supr.cl/playbrawl\nBe a BRAWLER!
