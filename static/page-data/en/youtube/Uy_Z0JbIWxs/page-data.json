Your mom and your daughter may have been ready to reunite with you in Heaven, but we weren't ready to lose you on Earth. You were a real life Angel, giving hope, inspiration and love to Billions of people all around the world touched by your amazing work. You may be gone now, but you will always live in our hearts, and your legacy of changing lives will live on forever 🙏🏽❤️\n\nFor those that don't know, Carl was in a coma for some time. His doctors said that he wasn't going to make it. His close friends and family said their final goodbyes to him. Then we called on our incredible community to pray for him and ask God for a miracle to happen. And it did. Carl regained consciousness long enough to see his wife over Zoom, for her to sing to him, and for him read some of the hundreds of thousands of comments people left for him all over the world telling him how much he meant to them. And he must've had a big smile on his face reading them. For that I am grateful, knowing his heart must have been full of so much love before God called His Angel back. It makes me so happy to know that you got to see how impactful your life was and how much you meant to everybody.\n\nI have been in touch with his family and we will be helping to take care of his final expenses. We are setting up a memorial for him at our studio and we will continue to share his work for many, many years to come so everyone can know what an incredible man he was. If Carl touched your life and you would also like to help his family who is dealing with tremendous grief, you can donate through this GoFundMe link: https://gofund.me/55f679bb. All proceeds go to his family.\n\n\"With tears of sorrow we cry each day, in angel's arms you were carried away. Our memories of love and laughter shall not fade, for inside our hearts you will always stay.\"\n\n- Dhar Mann\n\nP.S.
