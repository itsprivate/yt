This video, all the mobs in Minecraft try and take my friends and run away with them. I have to save them when they are captured and defend them while trying to beat the game. They can't attack mobs, only I can... This was one of the funnest/funniest challenges we've ever done!

Lyrics:
In a room full of dimes you would be 100 dollars
If being fine was a crime, girl, they’d lock your lil’ fine ass up in a tower
The way you move like you do
Ooh it’s like you do it for a livin’
Do a lil’ spin, do it again – sshhiiiii
look like you playin’ for the win, OH BABY

I’m trynna roll, I’m trynna ride
I’m trynna float, I’m trynna glide
No no, don’t be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight

Oh, skate to me baby
Skate
Slide your way on over
Slide your way on over
Skate to me baby
Skate
I wanna get to know ya
I wanna get to know ya

Got your hair in the wind and your skin glistening
I can smell your sweet perfume
Mmmm, ya smell better than a barbecue
Oh, superstar is what you are
I’m your biggest fan
if you’re lookin’ for a man, suga, here I am

I’m trynna roll, I’m trynna ride
I’m trynna float, I’m trynna glide
No no, don’t be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight!

Oh, skate to me baby
Skate
Slide your way on over
Slide your way on over
Skate to me baby
Skate
I wanna get to know ya
I wanna get to know ya

I never fall but tonight you got me falling for you, and only you, YOU
I’m reaching out in hopes that you reach for me too, girl, let’s groove

Girl, you got me singing ooooooohhhh
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my

Oh, skate to me baby
Skate
Slide your way on over
Slide your way on over
Skate to me baby
Skate
I wanna get to know ya
I wanna get to know ya

This is a Minecraft Challenge in which I try to survive 100 Days, and I Shapeshift every day! There are also crazy Custom Shapeshifts like the Orangutang, Shark and the WARDEN. This is not a Minecraft Speedrunner VS Hunter, but a 'Minecraft 100 Days' challenge... This was completely insane.

Also, I had to play on 'Hard' difficulty instead of 'Hardcore' since the shapeshifter mod counted me shapeshifting as dying and deleted the world. Hopefully you guys understand!

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt Assassins. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is not one hunter but TWO instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

This video, my friends can one shot me in Minecraft. If they hit me at all, I die, and I lose. If I look at them, they are frozen with lazer beams on them. They can't move or hit me at all. They have to sneak up on me.

If this video gets 2,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt Assassins. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is not one hunter but TWO instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap tries to prevent me from doing it. It&apos;s a race, and it&apos;s super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

http://x.ea.com/69275

A visionary Legend, Seer harnesses a swarm of micro-drones to find a clear path to victory. With an artist’s perspective, he sees beauty in the chaos.

And there’s plenty of chaos to go around: thanks to overmining, World’s Edge is crumbling beneath the Legends’ feet. Seer’s not the only one with an eye for potential: Rampart’s taken the opportunity to invent a new LMG that turns Thermite Grenades into literal firepower. Call it the Rampage.

Keep your gaze steady and your feet light when Apex Legends: Emergence launches on August 3. These might just be the most dangerous Games yet. 


Apex Legends™ is a free-to-play hero shooter  game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier. Play for free now on PlayStation® 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Origin and Steam.

Oscar nominee Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) directs Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name.

A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.

The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”), Oscar Isaac (the “Star Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr. Long,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), David Dastmalchian (“Blade Runner 2049,” “The Dark Knight”), Sharon Duncan-Brewster (“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Netflix’s “Sex Education”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).

Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert. Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter and Joe Caracciolo, Jr. The executive producers are Tanya Lapointe, Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert.

Behind the scenes, Villeneuve reteamed with two-time Oscar-nominated production designer Patrice Vermette (“Arrival,” “Sicario,” “The Young Victoria”), two-time Oscar-nominated editor Joe Walker (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival,” “12 Years a Slave”), two-time Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”). He also collaborated for the first time with Oscar-nominated director of photography Greig Fraser (“Lion,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”); three-time Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and costume designer Robert Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”). Oscar-winning and multiple Oscar-nominated composer Hans Zimmer (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Inception,” “Gladiator,” “The Lion King”) is creating the score.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, a Film by Denis Villeneuve, “Dune.” The film is slated to be released in select theaters in 2D and 3D and IMAX and on HBO Max on October 22, 2021 and will be available on HBO Max’s Ad-Free plan in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English Only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release.

The film has been rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material.]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/8g18jFHCLXk</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/8g18jFHCLXk</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 20:31:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>IT’S TIME. #DuneMovie coming October 22.

If our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. The Weeknd showed up to assist his pal with the dreamy mood of “off the table.” As proven previously on tracks such as “Love Me Harder” and “Save Your Tears,” their chemistry is deep. The two stars glide through the song, helping each other reveal the nooks and crannies that are only obvious to accomplished musicians.
