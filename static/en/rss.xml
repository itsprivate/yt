Lyrics:

We wanna celebrate like we in the club every day
Got all my friends here with me
And I don't need ya, I don't need ya
 
Got this dress up on me
So I don't need your stress up on me
Baby, we're done, c'est la vie
Now I don't need ya, I don't need ya
 
Should've left your ass from time ago
Didn't love me then, but now I do
I used to sit at home and cry for you
Diamonds on my neck, I shine for you
Ain't blocking my blessings anymore
Never be the girl I was before
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down
 
From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me, so V.I.P
All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti
Drop it down
You're missin' me, but I'm finally free
I got what I need, so let it rain down like Confetti
 
Flashing lights, I ain't got no worry on my mind
Know that you're mad, I realised
That I don't need ya, I don't need ya
 
So, DJ, say my name like it's my birthday
You're just a memory
And, boy, I don't need ya, I don't need ya
Should've left your ass from time ago (time ago)
Didn't love me then, but now I do (now I do)
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down
 
From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me (on me, yeah), so v.I.p
All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti (woah)
Drop it down
You're missin' me, but I'm finally free (finally free)
I got what I need, so let it rain down like confetti
Down (Oh, la-la-la)
Rain down (oh, la-la-la)
Let it, let it rain down (oh, la-la-la) – leigh ad lib
Let it rain down (oh, la-la-la) -  leigh ad lib 
  
So my girl hit me up about her f*ck boy dude 
I say hold on hold what you say he did to you 
Caught him sending d*ck pics and a couple of nudes
Sh*t we can chop it off and imma Bobbit in stew
 
Cuz I don’t play that shit— no no 
Beat his ass on — slowmo 
Ride or ride on— gogo 
N**** I’m a Yoko Ono 
I’m an artsy b*tch
U gonna miss these lips 
Now I’mma have to slap yours wit my swavorski tips 

I’m a cancer baby but I got Scorpio ways 
Credit high on all MY cards top one is my face
Getta pedi in my tessie ya there’s plenty of space  
New it girl on the block they all copy and paste 

Face on Halle body on Chloe 
Ain’t giving you a chance imma give it to ya homie 
Mood on petty
So promiscuous 
How u getting to the bag when u ain’t getting this?
 
From the sky, drop like confetti (yeah)
All eyes on me, so V.I.P
All of my dreams (all of my dreams, whoa)
From the sky, drop like confetti
You're missin' me (you're missing me)

I'm totally free (I'm finally free)
I got what I need (I've got what I need)

Twenty One Pilots - Livestream Experience
May 21 @ 8PM ET / 5PM PT
Tickets available at http://live.twentyonepilots.com 

Stream / Download "Choker" - https://top.lnk.to/SAI
Pre-order / Pre-Save Scaled And Icy - https://top.lnk.to/SAI

Directed by Mark C. Eshleman for Reel Bear Media

LYRICS
I don't bother anyone
Nervous when I stand
Choking on the circumstance
Only smoking secondhand
Cut us open, spread us out
Dry us in the sand
Lay the fibers side-by-side
And you'll begin to understand

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me.
...coming for me

I don't bother anyone
Never make demands
Choking on the circumstance
Self-sabotage is a sweet romance
Seems like all I'm worth is what
I'm able to withstand
Sooner I can realize
That pain is just a middle man.

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me.

I see no volunteers
to co-sign on my fears
I'll sign on the line
Alone.

I'm gonna change my circumstance
I know I need to move right now
'cause...

I know it's over
I was born a choker
Nobody's coming for me.
(only smoking secondhand)

Like a little splinter
buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out
But when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less
and you can even push it further in
When your body's screaming out
Trust your mind's listening.
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As the shadow casts upon the ground
where you'll eventually
lay forever, but the day goes on
the sun moves behind you
You get taller, bolder, stronger, 
and the rear-view only blinds you

Lyrics:
Verse 1
Ain’t nothin plain on me nigga 
Four chains on me 
Ian trippin bout that hoe nigga she came on me 
I gotta bitch from the west she ah suck ah nigga soft
Bitch from the east she a fuck a nigga dawg
Still playing with that raw even tho I gotta deal 
Had to get up out the city I just got nigga killed 
Pause I’m lying kinda still sippin out the Fanta 
Oxycotin and Opanas I want 4-2 for each nigga
Niggas up Lou for free nigga 
That’s my nigga come and kick it 
Mr. Still A Serve The City 
I’m the reason it’s some chicken 
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one
Daire quit pulling on the blender for you burn something
Baby say she wanna real nigga she don’t get it 
Why you ain’t never up at night I told you I been sipping
Still gone hold it for my nigga wish I can bring you back 
turntest in the city white lows blue flags 
naw I keep two flags I’m back
I just dropped years for the gang
Catch me in the city young nigga four chains 
Signed to CMG still in the dope gang
Ion swipe propane really got it out the mud
Big fo gang catch me riding with the thugs
I got it on my own ain’t nobody help me 
Remain humble sell crack to dope fiends
You can’t lil bro me bitch I really gotta check 
Throw two in his shit I be really on that 
Put the city on my back still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
Pull up in frog eyes yeah nigga we winning

Roddy Ricch
Me & 42 pulling up twin villains 
Peanut butter seats so my windows tinted

Roddy Ricch
Turnt from the D to LA 
Always keep it a hunnid K
Number one nigga but they never gone admit it 
I was doing two hunnid in a Rarri and got a ticket
Every time they see me they say they ain’t see me in a minute
Prolly fucking on ya bitches prolly running up some digits
Forgiato wheels both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation Feds try to put us on the board never identified 
All my niggas always getting doe it’s always chicken time 
I got niggas in the box gone call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they said if it ain’t directed then don’t respect it
You see em out in public they gone act like they never said it 
I see by the C side I throw it up two times 
Yo nigga got it gangsta Carti bought it off groupon 
One of the young niggas that be getting love in the city 
From the hood to the dub in the tub pull up with em

Daughter of notorious Titan Pilot Viper, Valkyrie lost her father at a young age. She inherited her father’s love of flight, but not his sense of duty. Except in one regard. She swore to kill the man who’d sent her father to die: his Faction Leader, Kuben Blisk. But when the moment came to pull the trigger, she hesitated -- he spoke of Viper with respect. And he challenged her to be better. Valkyrie shot him anyway, but she didn’t take his life. Just his invitation card to the Apex Games.

Valkyrie’s jetpack – forged from the remnant’s of Viper’s Northstar Titan – allows her to fly above the battlefield for a limited time. When it’s time to swoop in for the kill, she can unleash a swarm of missiles to damage and disorient her enemy. And if things get too hot she can employ her Ultimate – which allows her and her entire squad the ability to quickly reposition and find the next fight. Valkyrie enters the games with something to prove and ready to rain death down from on high.

There’s nowhere to hide this season, Legends. Ready to find out if you’re predator or prey? Discover your true nature when Apex Legends – Legacy launches May 4!

Apex Legends™ is a free-to-play battle royale game where legendary characters battle for glory, fame, and fortune on the fringes of the Frontier. Play for free now on PlayStation® 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Origin and Steam.

They say nothing lasts forever

With no make-up and a million

A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

PSG came out firing in the first half and converted one of their many chances into a goal. Marquinhos scored in the 15’ to give PSG the lead. PSG kept the pressure on in the first half and finished with 9 shots on goal. 

In the second half PSG was content to sit back and defend the one goal lead. Manchester City took advantage and notched two goals both from set pieces. 
De Bruyne scored in the 64' when he tried to play the ball to the far post off of a free kick and instead found the back of the bet. Then Mahrez put the English side ahead in the 71' when he found the hole in the PSG wall off of a free kick right outside the box. 

Manchester City was able to maintain that one goal lead and will head back home with a huge advantage on aggregate.

Watch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s Luca and see the film June 18 on Disney+. 

Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Disney and Pixar’s original feature film “Luca” is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: they are sea monsters from another world just below the water’s surface. Directed by Academy Award® nominee Enrico Casarosa (“La Luna”) and produced by Andrea Warren (“Lava,” “Cars 3”), “Luca” releases June 18 on Disney+.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the world’s richest countries poured money into the race for a vaccine. Billions of dollars, from programs like the US’s Operation Warp Speed, funded development that brought us multiple Covid-19 vaccines in record time. But it also determined where those vaccines would go. Before vaccine doses had even hit the market, places like the US and the UK had bought up nearly the entire supply.

This turns out to be an old story. In nearly every modern global health crisis, from smallpox to malaria to H1N1, rich countries have bought up vital medical supplies, making poor countries wait sometimes decades for life-saving support. It’s effectively a system in which where you live determines whether you live or die of a preventable disease. Leaving a disease like Covid-19 to spread unchecked in some places also gives it a chance to mutate -- and variants of the virus are already raising alarms. So: how do we get vaccines to countries that can’t afford them?

One solution underway is called Covax. It’s a program co-led by the World Health Organization; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Its goal is to get vaccines to lower- and middle-income countries at the same time as rich countries. So how is it supposed to do that? And will it be enough?

Can’t Use Me Lyrics:
[Chorus]
It’s crazy how the money makes the lies feel like the truth
And everybody phony you just do not have the proof
I jot it on my pad and record it in booth
I don’t need a shrink
Just press record and let me loose
I’m tryna separate all these emotions that I’m guarded with
I’m getting mixed emotions from the people that I started with
Feeling like it’s fake love, only for the sponsorships
Scratch em off the dean's list, cancel all the scholarships
 
[Verse 1]
I can’t let you use me
Flattery don’t move me
Say action, they capping, like acting in movies
Fake s**t, I hate it ‘cause I give the true me
It’s sad when the grown men who act like the groupies
I can feel these n****s hating
Tummy ache because they snaking
Crawling on the belly, undercut for information
Man these n****s super different
They gon’ make me come and shake em
Kick em off the court and call the 6th man to replace em
I’ma m***********g bully, like a killer but adjacent
‘Cause I don’t gotta shoot you to show you I ain’t playing
Got the big devil horns, love the lord, but can be satan
Leave a n***a stanking then Febreze the situation
 
[Chorus]
It’s crazy how the money makes the lies feel like the truth
And everybody phony you just do not have the proof
I jot it on my pad and record it in booth
I don’t need a shrink
Just press record and let me loose
I’m tryna separate all these emotions that I’m guarded with
I’m getting mixed emotions from the people that I started with
Feeling like it’s fake love, only for the sponsorships
Scratch em off the dean's list, cancel all the scholarships
 
[Verse 2]
We ain’t got trust, we ain’t got s**t n***a, that’s on the gang
I would die for you but tell me would you do the same 
N****s will kill for you, steal from you, keep a straight face
Don’t let a snake invade your circle, keep a close space
And if you my dawg then why you think I can set you up
You ain’t really my dog, if you ain’t gon’ speak up
Worst thing that’s gon’ happen is we prolly gon’ knuckle up
But you my n***a no matter who won the scuffle bra
It’s a different kinda vibe when you dealing with your real guys
Only day ones, just the ones that’s for life
Stepping on some big necks
Never capping stay light
Please don’t make slide n****s
Shots will get your steps right
 
[Chorus]
It’s crazy how the money makes the lies feel like the truth
And everybody phony you just do not have the proof
I jot it on my pad and record it in booth
I don’t need a shrink
Just press record and let me loose
I’m tryna separate all these emotions that I’m guarded with
I’m getting mixed emotions from the people that I started with
