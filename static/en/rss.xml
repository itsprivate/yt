If so, your most common question has been, "When is Season Two coming out?" Or in many cases, it hasn't been a question, it's been more like, "GIVE ME SEASON TWO NOW!" Well, the wait is over. Launching with a huge global livestream Easter Sunday at 8pm ET (important details below), Season Two is here.

Haven't seen The Chosen? Don't watch this trailer! We encourage you to catch up on Season One fast, because we can't promise the millions who will watch Season Two won't reveal spoilers. So stop what you're doing and go "binge Jesus," as we like to say.

"How do I watch The Chosen?" Good question. It's free and easy. Yes, free...doesn't even require an email address. Look up "The Chosen" wherever you get your phone apps, download it, and then you can freely and easily connect it directly from there to your streaming device (Apple TV, Firestick, Roku, Chromecast). Don't have a streaming device? Probably time to get one.

"Wait, free and easy? How is that possible?" Again, good question. We happen to be the #1 highest crowd-funded media project of all time, which means we've done this completely outside the system. We built our own app, we've sold our own DVDs, and instead of requiring payment to watch, we offer you the chance to "pay it forward" so we can continue to keep it free and also produce future seasons. But you don't have to. Seriously.

We're watched in literally every country in the world, we've been translated into over 50 languages, and we've heard from literally millions of people that getting to know the authentic Jesus has changed their life.

Season Two launches Easter Sunday, 8:00pm ET, with a huge global livestream on our FB & Youtube channels and "The Chosen" app, and from then on, it'll be available forever.

Welcome to The Chosen. Get used to different.

An enormous thanks to Prof. Steven Strogatz — this video would not have been possible without him. Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast "The Joy of X" is wonderful — please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x

The new killer is Ji-Woon Hak, better known to fans across the globe as The Trickster. Famed singer by day, calculating serial killer by night, The Trickster thirsts for notoriety, treating both his music and his murders as high art. The new Survivor is Yun-Jin Lee, a resilient and ambitious music producer who built her reputation on the success of her one and only client – The Trickster. Ignoring his true nature in favor of her career, Yun-Jin now stands to pay the ultimate price for her ambition.  

 The ALL-KILL Chapter is available now in Dead by Daylight.   

Learn more about the Chapter: https://bit.ly/3qTs5tm

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer action/horror game where one player takes on the role of a brutal Killer and the other four play as Survivors.

A criminal mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice in Spiral, the terrifying new chapter from the book of Saw. Working in the shadow of his father, an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash Detective Ezekiel “Zeke” Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city’s gruesome past.  Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer’s morbid game.

Spiral stars Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Marisol Nichols, and Samuel L. Jackson, and is produced by the original Saw team of Mark Burg and Oren Koules. The film is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger.

Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN11 will be powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN11 will perform a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.
  
The Starship prototype will descend under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. SN11’s Raptor engines will then reignite as the vehicle attempts a landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down on the landing pad adjacent to the launch mount. 

A controlled aerodynamic descent with body flaps and vertical landing capability, combined with in-space refilling, are critical to landing Starship at destinations across the solar system where prepared surfaces or runways do not exist, and returning to Earth. This capability will enable a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond.  

Given the dynamic schedule of development testing, stay tuned to our social media channels for updates as we move toward SpaceX’s fourth high-altitude flight test of Starship!]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/gjCSJIAKEPM</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/gjCSJIAKEPM</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 19:44:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>As early as Tuesday, March 30, the SpaceX team will attempt a high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 11 (SN11) – our fourth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from Starbase in Texas.

Hello friends and welcome to another video! So, late last year we decided to take the plunge and move across the country for a fresh start in a new place. After doing some serious decluttering, we packed up our house, grabbed our cat, and hit the road (and vlogged our whole cross-country road trip in our minivan!) It's been a couple of months and we are finally set up enough to dive back into making videos, so here is our moving vlog! Hopefully you guys enjoy it, and thank you for being so patient with us while we figure all of this out. 

Also, sorry about any smudginess of the windshield! It was tough to keep clean on our drive, but I know sometimes it can look gross, so sorry about that! Lol

Engineers are working round the clock to refloat the Ever Given. The vessel has been blocking one of the world's busiest shipping lanes for the last five days. The chairman of the canal authority hopes a dredging operation will free the ship in the next few days.
How did the Ever Given, one of the biggest container ships ever built, end up blocking one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes? And how long will it stay there? The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority is facing more questions than he can answer. But he says more than just strong winds caused the accident.
But while experts investigate further, the ship still has to be freed. 20,000 ton of sand have been removed from the area around the bow, and 9,000 tons of ballast water have been pumped out, in order to lighten the vessel. The operation has so far been unsuccessful - but two more tugs are on their way. If they can't move it, the next step will be to unload the cargo.
The German insurance group Allianz says the blockage is costing the global economy between 6 and 10 billion dollars a week. A tenth of the world's merchant shipping uses the canal.

Nelson Palm Sunday Invitation]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shares a story illustrating how to find peace in troubling times and circumstances. As the world seeks relief from the stains of a disrupted year, President Nelson reminds us there is only one way to find the solemnity and tranquility of lasting peace—the enduring peace that passes all understanding. That surpassing peace is found in Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace.

As Christians around the world join to celebrate Palm Sunday, President Nelson invites all to make the coming week a time of holiness by remembering not just the palms that were waved to herald Jesus Christ’s entrance into Jerusalem but the palms of His hands that are a mark of His selfless sacrifice.
