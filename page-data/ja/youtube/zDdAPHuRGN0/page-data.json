Go to http://www.audible.com/yestheory or text \"yestheory\" to 500 500 and start listening today!\n\nCheck out my friend @Johnny Harris first story about this conflict here:\nhttps://youtu.be/p7_TZagxjyk\n\nCheck out @Nathaniel Drew ‘s Channel who joined us on this trip as well.\n\nThis was probably one of the most complicated stories we've ever had to tell. For my Cypriots watching, I wish you peace and prosperity for the future. I hope you enjoyed this piece and understand that not every single detail of the story could be highlighted. I could've spent hours going into all of the intricacies of this conflict and tried to stay balance and unbiased as I simply came an observer.\n\nVarosha is one of the largest and most tragic ghost towns on the planet. Once filled with tens of thousands of tourists every year it's been abandoned now for about 47 years... The conflict in Cyprus is far from being resolved and unfortunately is growing in complexity as the years go by. Sending hope and positivity to all the Cypriots out there, thank you for hosting me in your country.\n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\n✈ Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Yes Theory Plus: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTd7KzdwnFE3lm6LCfYDmUQ\n📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.
