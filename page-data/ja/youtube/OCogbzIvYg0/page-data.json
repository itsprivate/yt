\n(Chorus) \nYou say you love me but I don’t care \nThat I broke my hand on the same wall that you told me that he fucked you on \nYou think it’s so easy \nFuckin’ with my feelings \nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n \nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n\n(Verse 1) \nSaid you wanna have my babies \nI fucked you so good, you should pay me \nDon’t call me baby \nWhen you did me so wrong \nBut I got over what you did already \nBody for a body I’m so petty \nHow many of your friends fit in my Rolls \nBought you a new face \nYou should call me Dad baby \nHermes \nBut you dropped the bag baby \nTruth is \nMaybe one’s just not enough \n\n(Chorus) \nYou say you love me but I don’t care \nThat I broke my hand on the same wall that you told me that he fucked you on \nYou think it’s so easy \nFuckin’ with my feelings \n\nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n\nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n\n(Verse 2) \nYou’re a stain on my legacy \nWe can’t be friends, can’t be family \nYou probably fuck all my enemies \nI can’t let you be next to me oh \nYou belong to the world now \nSo just leave me alone now \nWe’re not in touch no more \n \n(Chorus) \nYou say you love me but I don’t care \nThat I broke my hand on the same wall that you told me that he fucked you on \nYou think it’s so easy \nFuckin’ with my feelings \nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n \nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now \n \nI got one comin’ over and one right now \nOne right now
