You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up with the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.\n\nThe best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.\n\nThis is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.\n\nSee you in class!\n\n-Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor entertainment purposes only.
