I also wanna give a reaction to the new look and discuss some plot leaks on the film but obviously I'll talk about that at the end of the video incase you wanna avoid some of the major spoilers.\n\nThat being said there will be some of the more minor ones in this first part of the video so if you've managed to avoid some of the biggest reveals on the web and don't want things ruined then I recommend that you swing out of here.\n\nWith that out the way there's no way back from this point onwards, now let's get into the No Way Home Trailer Breakdown.\n\nOk so the first trailer for the movie very much tackled the first part of the film. It pretty much showed the ramification of Peter's name being revealed, how it changed his life, his attempt to change things with the help of Doctor Strange and how this ultimately backfired and brought across several characters from across the multiverse.\n\nNow as for this trailer it leans heavily into the villains, gives some of their motivations and character beats and it also reveals their incredible costumes before ending on a big tease.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\nTrack Name: \"Take Me With You\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com","slug":"/youtube/suoSXEgnKOY","title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs, Villains Explained & Hidden Details","date":"November 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown｜イースターエッグ、悪役の説明、隠されたディテール","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"蜘蛛侠之路》官方预告片解读｜复活节彩蛋、恶棍解释及隐藏细节","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蜘蛛俠之路》官方預告片解讀｜復活節彩蛋、惡棍解釋及隱藏細節","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:JfVOs4VSpmA","excerpt":"We started getting visitors… from every universe.
