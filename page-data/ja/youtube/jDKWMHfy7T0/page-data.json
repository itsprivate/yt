The Disney+ original docuseries, directed by\nPeter Jackson, will be arriving on Disney+ just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. Made\nentirely from never-before-seen, restored footage, it provides the most intimate and honest\nglimpse into the creative process and relationship between John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever\nfilmed.  Be sure to check them both out, and don’t forget to watch “The Beatles: Get Back” when\nit rolls out over three days, November 25, 26, and 27, 2021, exclusively on Disney+.\n\nDirected by three-time Oscar®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson (“The Lord of the Rings” trilogy,\n“They Shall Not Grow Old”), “The Beatles: Get Back” takes audiences back in time to the band’s\nJanuary 1969 recording sessions, which became a pivotal moment in music history. The\ndocuseries showcases The Beatles’ creative process as they attempt to write 14 new songs in\npreparation for their first live concert in over two years. Faced with a nearly impossible deadline,\nthe strong bonds of friendship shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and\nRingo Starr are put to the test. The docuseries is compiled from nearly 60 hours of unseen\nfootage shot over 21 days, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and from more than 150\nhours of unheard audio, most of which has been locked in a vault for over half a century.\nJackson is the only person in 50 years to have been given access to this Beatles treasure trove,\nall of which has now been brilliantly restored.  What emerges is an unbelievably intimate portrait\nof The Beatles, showing how, with their backs against the wall, they could still rely on their\nfriendship, good humor, and creative genius. While plans derail and relationships are put to the\ntest, some of the world’s most iconic songs are composed and performed. The docuseries\nfeatures – for the first time in its entirety – The Beatles’ last live performance as a group, the\nunforgettable rooftop concert on London’s Savile Row, as well as other songs and classic\ncompositions featured on the band’s final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be.\n\nAn exciting new collaboration between The Beatles and Jackson presented by The Walt Disney\nStudios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd., “The Beatles:\nGet Back” is directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono\nLennon, Olivia Harrison, Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen (“They Shall Not Grow Old”) and\nJonathan Clyde (“Eight Days a Week”), with Apple Corps’ Jeff Jones (“Eight Days a Week”) and\nKen Kamins (“The Hobbit” trilogy) serving as executive producers. Jabez Olssen (“Rogue One:\nA Star Wars Story”) serves as the film’s editor, the music supervisor is Giles Martin\n(“Rocketman”), Michael Hedges (“The Adventures of Tintin”) and Brent Burge (“The Hobbit”\ntrilogy) serve as the series re-recording mixers, and the music is mixed by Giles Martin and Sam\nOkell (“Yesterday”).\n\n#TheBeatlesGetBack","slug":"/youtube/Tb83rbm0IVI","title":"The Beatles: Get Back | Official Trailer | Disney+","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 13, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ビートルズ ゲットバック｜公式予告編｜Disney+（ディズニープラス","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"披头士乐队。官方预告片|迪斯尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"披頭士樂隊。官方預告片|迪斯尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:jDKWMHfy7T0","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:R6HA8lGJ1-w","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Tb83rbm0IVI","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/youtube/jDKWMHfy7T0","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
