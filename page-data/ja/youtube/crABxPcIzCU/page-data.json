That's right, forget the Monster Jam, if you want to win the real thing, all you have to do is stay on. Each person got 10 minutes to prepare. Liz and Deniesse turned the truck into a girl's lounge, Hunter got his drone, Andrew made a sled and Carder made an RC car chariot!! Did you know remote control cars could do that?? Hunter got hungry and ordered a Papa John's pizza which was somehow delivered using his drone?! In the end, this was a very rare two-person win for a Last to Leave competition. Do you agree with the results??
