The Minecraft wither spider I made is a reference to the time where I redesigned minecraft bosses in 3d software\n\n//about\nMy name's daniel and I design things. Usually I do 3d modeling in blender but I'm now a metal worker thanks to mr beast apparently??? Who knows what I'll design in the future.
