A portion of this video was premiered during the Streamys, so thank you so much to the Streamys for featuring us! You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg\n\nHere is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I’ve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own — and though I’m not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??\n\nAlso, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea & Megan for letting us film at your store!\n\nCheck out our new merch here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com/\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","body":"HELLO FRIENDS!!
