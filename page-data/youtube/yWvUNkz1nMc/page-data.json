Blaster bolts brightness made covert operations very difficult, even for the most skilled bounty hunters and military personnel. The Empire wished to conduct secretive assassinations, and therefore developed the nightstinger rifle. It could only fire 3-5 shots before the blaster gas canister needed replacing, with each canister costing around 1000 credits. However, the blaster bolts were completely invisible, allowing for stealthy assassinations. This was particularly useful when used in conjunction with a redirection crystal. When the invisible bolt was fired at the crystal it would redirect the bolt while also adding colouration, allowing the empire to frame unsuspecting citizens for their brutal exterminations. \n\n#blaster #blasters #starwarsweapons #starwarscomics #starwarslegends #starwarslore #starwarsexplained #starwars  #starwarsshorts #vadersfortress #shorts","slug":"/youtube/lHQ6lbLFQCg","title":"What Was The Illegal Blaster Rifle That Fired Invisible Blaster Bolts? #shorts","date":"September 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"目に見えないブラスターボルトを発射する、違法なブラスターライフルとは何だったのか？#ショートパンツ","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"发射隐形冲击波的非法冲击波步枪是什么？#短裤","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"發射隱形衝擊波的非法衝擊波步槍是什麼？#短褲","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:qwIzroS0Lfo","excerpt":"I Turned My Cat Into Lego!
