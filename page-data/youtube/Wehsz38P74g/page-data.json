Introducing my brand new Audi S1 e-tron quattro Hoonitron! Brian and I take a quick trip to Audi’s Design Center in Ingolstadt, Germany to see my 1 of 1 Gymkhana Prototype.

The all-electric Hoonitron is essentially a fully modernized version of one of my favorite race cars, the legendary Group B Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2, so I'm extremely excited for this. All that's left now is to patiently wait for my opportunity to Hoon it.\n\nSubscribe to my channel for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/KenBlockHHIC\nFollow me on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kblock43\nFollow on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/kenblockracing\n\nRad gear that The Hoonigans make for me: https://www.hoonigan.com/collections/ken-block\n\n#BlockGoesEtron\n#BLOCKxAUDI\n#AudiPartner","slug":"/youtube/nCXyP7sl1Cg","title":"Ken Block’s NEW Audi #S1HOONITRON Gymkhana Prototype!","date":"December 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ケン・ブロックの新型アウディ #S1HOONITRON ジムカーナ・プロトタイプ!","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Ken Block的新奥迪#S1HOONITRON Gymkhana Prototype!","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Ken Block的新奧迪#S1HOONITRON Gymkhana Prototype!","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:2Oev6TJTd90","excerpt":"We Stayed Overnight In A Murder House\n\njoin my patreon https://www.patreon.com/larray !!! revenue made from patreon will be donated to charities of our choice that we will pick as a community at the end of every month on Patreon.
