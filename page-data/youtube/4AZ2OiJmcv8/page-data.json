Wimbledon on Wednesday night.\n\nRoared on by a vociferous home crowd, we made a sharp start to the game as Gabi Martinelli caused problems for the Dons defence from the off.\n\nIndeed, it was the Brazilian who won the penalty for the opening goal as he reacted swiftly to latch on to an Eddie Nketiah through ball, before being bundled over in the area.\n\nAlex Lacazette stepped up and made no mistake from the spot, sending it into the bottom right-hand corner.\n\nWe continued to threaten sporadically through a low-key first half, but save for a corner that looped up threateningly and bounced in the Wimbledon six-yard box, there was little in the way of goalmouth action.\n\nPartey took aim just before the hour mark with a powerful drive from the edge of the area that Nik Tzanev did well to palm around the post – and the Wimbledon keeper had to be sharp to deny Nuno Tavares soon afterwards.\n\nWe were pushing and pushing for the second, and finally with 13 minutes remaining we had it as Emile Smith Rowe doubled our advantage from close range.\n\nTwo minutes later we added a third – and this was the best of the night – as Cedric raced into the area and pulled the ball back, for Nketiah to flick into the far corner with a backheel.\n\nThere was still time for Bukayo Saka to go close twice before the final whistle, but in the end we had to settle for the three goals and a place in the next round.\n\n#arsenal #nketiah #smithrowe #lacazette \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vivianne
