I was kind of random about these minecraft thoughts but that is a okay in my opinion. I don't have a boss! You can't fire me! \nI maybe should have had more structure in here but I think I made some solid enough jokes where it can stand up on its own though :) sold out pretty hard this video though lol going to take a sponsorship break after this for a little while. I feel like you guys earned it.\nThere's a part in the video where I screen cap the suggested page and trending page and there's like TommyInnit and Jschlatt and JaidenAnimations in there so I guess you can see what the youtube algorithm wants me to watch. Very Pochamp.\nMinecraft is the game I have played most and I love it so this video was more or less self indulgent for me. I hope it makes you laugh at least once.\nI made a highschool presentation about minecraft and I got a good grade but probably only because the teacher felt sorry for me.\nI love the cozy minecraft rain and listening to it inside my house. It is so comfortable.\nThe Allay is the new minecraft mob that won minecraft live vote! I voted for the Allay because he is more helpful even though the copper golem was really cute.\n\nthank you for watching ❤️\n\nNEW MERCH IS HERE:\nhttps://icecreamsandwich.store/\n📱 twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\n📷 instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/","slug":"/youtube/5IDc88fmRUM","title":"unorganized minecraft thoughts","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 22, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"整理されていないマインクラフトの思考","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"无组织的Minecraft思想","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"無組織的Minecraft思想","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:D71cBUeAL58","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Hl19px8jid0","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:5IDc88fmRUM","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/youtube/D71cBUeAL58","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
