So, a couple of months ago I got this ad on facebook for \"digital fashion\" - which, as a weird fashion lover, piqued my interest. So, I decided to use the DressX digital fashion service and \"wear\" digital clothes every day for a week to see how it turned out -- and then I posted those pictures to instagram to see what you all thought of my virtual digs! Which outfit from this week was your favorite? \n\nYou can check out DressX's website here! \nhttps://dressx.com/\n\nQuick note -- these looks that we bought are *not* NFTs, and most of DressX's looks are not NFTs -- (the ones in the app are also not NFTs) -- they seem to dipping their toes into that space, but for now it's mainly just photoshopping individual images!\n\nAlso, the shots in the art museum were taken in the middle of the summer, when mask mandates were lifted!\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur new livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur new YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nNez Covington\nJordan Schneier\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza","slug":"/youtube/qVfJheBp7Ys","title":"I Wore Digital Clothes For A Week","date":"September 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1週間デジタルウェアを着続けた","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我穿了一个星期的数码衣服","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我穿了一個星期的數碼衣服","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Xo9zzS4-2pU","excerpt":"Today, we embark on an impossible journey where everything in Pokémon is entirely randomized... yet somehow, I was presented with the perfect team known to man. \r\n➤ SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE: http://bit.ly/Sub2Alpharad\r\n➤ ALPHARAD MERCH: http://pleasebuymymerch.com\r\n➤ TWITTER: https://twitter.com/alpharad\r\n➤ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/alpharad\r\n➤ BECOME A MEMBER (and see early videos): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBODyKF0JMbUd6D9Bklyzbw/join\r\n\r\nSHOUTOUT TO MY FRIENDS WHO JOINED ME ON THIS JOURNEY:\n➤ @Captain Kidd: https://twitter.com/CaptainKiddYT\n➤ @Jome: https://twitter.com/JomeLaJome\n➤ @Aaronitmar: https://twitter.com/Aaronitmar\n➤ @Weegee Plays: https://twitter.com/WEEGEETHEGOD\n➤ Smith: https://twitter.com/SunflowerPillar\n\nTHUMBNAIL / OUTRO ART\r\n➤ NOVA1DUKE: http://twitter.com/nova1duke\r\n\r\n#Pokemon #Nuzlocke #Alpharad\r\n\r\n➤ Music Used:\r\nPokémon Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald Soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL46A49E65817F8577\nPokémon ORAS Soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mCMKp0o7xsJg57E0_Ws5m0IcHLDjczn\nDating Fight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8bpWkoC7A\nUltra Instinct Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTXofUuo1A8","slug":"/youtube/Xo9zzS4-2pU","title":"How I survived a RANDOMIZED Nuzlocke","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 25, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"RANDOMIZED Nuzlockeをどうやって乗り切ったか","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我是如何从一个随机的Nuzlocke中幸存下来的？","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是如何從一個隨機的Nuzlocke中倖存下來的？","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:fGdt1r3ipHc","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:qVfJheBp7Ys","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Xo9zzS4-2pU","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/youtube/fGdt1r3ipHc","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
