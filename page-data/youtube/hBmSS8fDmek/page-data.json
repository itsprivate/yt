I had a couple thoughts on state fair stuff and I made a video on those things. The state fair food primarily. Thank you to Jaiden to doing a little voice bit in the beginning there. It was literally one word but hey credit where credit is due.\n\nThe state fair has good food. I love it so much I was sad I couldn't go this year. There's corn dogs, cheese curds, french fries, cookies, milk and a ton more. There's a lot of other foods that I hate though but it's a big part of why people go in the first place. To each their own.\n\nThis video took longer to make because I was programming new tools to make the animation process easier. It was... kind of a weird thing to do. I hope it made the process faster but I didn't measure it so ..oops!\n\nI'm going to try to post a couple more times before the year ends. It's been too sparse this year.\n\nthank you for watching ❤️\n\n(new merch is happening so I won't plug what I have now)\n📱 twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\n📷 instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/\n\nDISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
