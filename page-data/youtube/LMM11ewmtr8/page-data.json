HPV affects 325 million women worldwide. \n\nThere are over one hundred different types of HPV—14 of which can cause cancer. In fact, HPV can cause cervical cancer, and it is the 4th most common cause of cancer in women. \n\nViruses like HPV can hide out in the body until your immune system is compromised by stress, a health condition, or old age. \n\nThe best natural home remedies for skin tags and warts are:\n1. Povidone-iodine\n2. Fresh garlic\n\nHere’s how to use them:\nStep 1: Crush up garlic and put it in a dish\nStep 2: Place a couple of drops of povidone-iodine in another dish\nStep 3: Mix a small amount of garlic and garlic juice with the iodine\nStep 4: Apply the solution topically to your wart or skin tag\nStep 5: Cover the area with a bandaid \nStep 6: Save the iodine and garlic mixture to apply twice daily (mixture will stay good for one day)\n\nFor some, this remedy can work within a day—for others, it may take up to 8 weeks. \n\nKeep in mind that insulin resistance can make your body more susceptible to warts, so make sure you’re on Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting if you’re not already. Check out my keto playlist to learn about Health Keto and IF. \n\n50mg of zinc daily can also help fight off viruses that may cause warts.\n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nTalk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
