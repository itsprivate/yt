The escape is only the beginning in all-new episodes of Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous, coming to Netflix on December 3rd!\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://uni.pictures/JW-Subscribe\n\nAbout Jurassic World: \nFrom Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment, Jurassic World immerses audiences of all ages in a new era of wonder and thrills where dinosaurs and humankind must learn to coexist. Jurassic World is set against a global backdrop of diverse locations, with a sprawling story grounded in believable science and populated by distinctive dinosaurs, heroic humans, and cunning villains at both ends of the evolutionary spectrum.\n\nCinema's only dinosaur-driven live action franchise, Jurassic World has earned three Academy Awards® and over $3.6 billion worldwide across four films. Its cross- generational appeal can be attributed to audiences' enduring fascination with dinosaurs and boundless imagination, both nurtured by each new installment. Jurassic World is more than a film franchise. It is a larger-than-life destination for exploration, discovery, and epic adventure. Dinosaurs live again, and they live in Jurassic World.\n\nConnect with Jurassic World\nWebsite: https://uni.pictures/JurassicWorldFal...\nLike Jurassic World on Facebook: https://uni.pictures/JWLike\nFollow Jurassic World on Twitter: https://uni.pictures/JWFollow\nFollow Jurassic World on Instagram: https://uni.pictures/JWInsta\nFollow on Snap: http://po.st/JWSnap\n\nConnect with Universal Pictures\nLike Universal Pictures of Facebook: https://uni.pictures/UPLike\nFollow Universal Pictures on Twitter: https://uni.pictures/UPFollow\nFollow Universal Pictures on Instagram: https://uni.pictures/UPInsta\nFollow on Snap: http://po.st/UPSnap\nDinosaur Protection Group: http://www.dinosaurprotectiongroup.com/ \nIsla Nublar Site: http://islanublar.jurassicworld.com/ \n\nSeason 4 Trailer | JURASSIC WORLD CAMP CRETACEOUS | NETFLIX\nhttps://youtu.be/bDLKclq8gkQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jurassicworld","slug":"/youtube/bDLKclq8gkQ","title":"Season 4 Trailer | JURASSIC WORLD CAMP CRETACEOUS | NETFLIX","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 11, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"シーズン4予告編｜JURASSIC WORLD CAMP CRETACEOUS｜NETFLIX","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"第四季预告片 | 侏罗纪世界CRETACEOUS营地 | NETFLIX","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"第四季預告片 | 侏羅紀世界CRETACEOUS營地 | NETFLIX","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:XwszQDYF_pY","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:WzFR5HsPcng","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:bDLKclq8gkQ","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/youtube/XwszQDYF_pY","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
