Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. \n \n“That’s my style. ‘Pitbull’ is always going to be on the attack,” said Cruz. “I think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.”\n \nDavis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis’ ribs.\n \nThe 27-year-old Baltimore native turned on the power in the fourth, alternating between the right hook and left cross behind his southpaw stance. More punishing blows came from Davis during the fifth. \n \n“He’s a shorter fighter, so I was throwing down on the top of his head,” said Davis. “I hit him with my knuckle and messed it up. I hurt my hand in the sixth round. No matter if the opponent is taller or shorter, I’ve got to get through it. He’s a warrior. Even though he didn’t win, a star was born tonight.”\n \n“It was right around the fifth round I saw that his hand wasn’t working correctly,” Cruz observed. \n \nDavis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.\n \nThe 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight’s end. \n \nNaturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.\n \n“Viva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,” he said.\n \nFollowing a successful title defense, Davis said he’s ready for all comers.\n \n“L.A., we did it for Kobe,” said Davis. “At the beginning of the fight, he came on strong. I felt as the fight was going, he was breaking down. But I hurt my hand, so I wasn’t able to get him out of there.\n \n“Whatever the best opportunity is for me, I’ll do it. All of them guys are easy work. I’m the top dog.”\n\n\n#GervontaDavis #DavisCruz #Isaac Cruz\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions","slug":"/youtube/7bbyfAsSlho","title":"Davis vs Cruz HIGHLIGHTS: December 15, 2021 | PBC on Showtime PPV","date":"December 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"デイビスvsクルーズHIGHLIGHTS 2021年12月15日｜PBC on Showtime PPV","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"戴维斯对克鲁兹的比赛精彩纷呈。2021年12月15日|PBC on Showtime PPV","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"戴維斯對克魯茲的比賽精彩紛呈。2021年12月15日|PBC on Showtime PPV","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:G_BhUxx-cwk","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:7bbyfAsSlho","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/youtube/G_BhUxx-cwk","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
