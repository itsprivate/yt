We help tear down the drivetrain to be swapped into Ed's LJ40 Golden Nugget. The plan is to make the swap as easy as possible and to give Ed a dependable driving vehicle that doesn't require a bunch of extra maintenance. Since Colt loves Suzuki's as much as he loves Jeep's we knew that we had to help get the Golden Nugget back on the road. Paul still has a lot of work cut out for him so make sure to continue following the process on Fabrats and Matt's Off Road Recovery Channels.\n\nIf You Liked This One...
