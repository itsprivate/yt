The more things change, the more they somehow stay the same. Perhaps we will experience an existential crisis as life falls apart all around us. Thank the lord for football to distract us from it.\n\nThe fifteen other teams in the NFC are looking to overthrow Tampa Bay as Super Bowl Champion; each with their stories and plotlines to consider and dissect. There are their stories, both the good and the bad.\n\nSomeone please end Brady's reign, if only for the league's sake.","slug":"/youtube/DaFP7KPJZoc","title":"The Haters Guide to the 2021 NFL Season: NFC Edition","date":"September 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The Haters Guide to the 2021 NFL Season: NFC版","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"2021年NFL赛季的仇恨者指南。NFC版","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年NFL賽季的仇恨者指南。NFC版","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:8EisGrIHH04","excerpt":"Directed by: Amber Park\n— \nListen to “skinny dipping”: https://SabrinaCarpenter.lnk.to/Skinny_Dipping \n \nFollow Sabrina Carpenter \nInstagram |  https://www.instagram.com/sabrinacarpenter/ \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/SabrinaAnnLynn \nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/sabrinacarpenter \nTikTok | https://www.tiktok.com/@sabrinacarpenter \nWebsite | https://www.sabrinacarpenter.com/ \n \nLyrics\n— \nIt’ll be a Wednesday \nand i’ll be going to this coffee shop\nhear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name \nand I look up from my phone and think there’s no chance its you but it is \nYou’ll say “hi”\nI’ll say “hi how are you”\nYou’ll say how’s your family how’s your sister \nI’ll say “Shannon’s being Shannon” \nand After a minute of nonsensical chatter \nYou’ll say well this was really nice maybe we should do this \nOn purpose sometime \nand it will have been long enough \nThat we won’t harp on \n \nArguments in your garage \nAll the ways we sabotaged it \nwhat it was and what it wasn’t \n \nWe’ve been swimming on the edge of a cliff \nI’m resistant but goin down with the ship \nit’d be so nice \nRight \nRight \nIf we could take it all off and just\nexist \nand skinny dip in water under under the bridge \n \nYou’ll suggest a restaurant we used to go to\nand i’ll say won’t that be too nostalgic\nand you’ll say maybe, but let’s do it anyway,\nwe won’t sit at our same old table\nI promise \nand we won’t bring up the past, we’ll keep it bureaucratic, \nand we won’t say it but both of us we’ll be thinking about how different we are are from those \nscared little kids that had those \n \nArguments in your garage \nAll the ways we sabotaged it \nwhat it \nwas and what it wasn’t \nWe’ve been swimming on the edge of a cliff \nI’m resistant but goin down with the ship \nit’d be so nice \nRight \nRight \nIf we could take it all off and just exist \nand skinny dip in water under under the bridge\n \n \nMusic video by Sabrina Carpenter performing skinny dipping. © 2021 Island Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.","slug":"/youtube/8EisGrIHH04","title":"Sabrina Carpenter - Skinny Dipping","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 09, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Sabrina Carpenter - Skinny Dipping","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"萨布丽娜-卡彭特 - 瘦肉浸泡","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"薩布麗娜-卡彭特 - 瘦肉浸泡","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:oUhBOmtFYr8","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:DaFP7KPJZoc","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:8EisGrIHH04","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/youtube/oUhBOmtFYr8","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
