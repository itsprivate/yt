This reimagining of the beloved musical stars Ansel Elgort (Tony); Rachel Zegler (María); Ariana DeBose (Anita); David Alvarez (Bernardo); Mike Faist (Riff); Josh Andrés Rivera (Chino); Ana Isabelle (Rosalía); Corey Stoll (Lieutenant Schrank); Brian d’Arcy James (Officer Krupke); and Rita Moreno (as Valentina, who owns the corner store in which Tony works). Moreno – one of only three artists to be honored with Academy®, Emmy®, GRAMMY®, Tony® and Peabody Awards – also serves as one of the film’s executive producers.\n \nBringing together the best of both Broadway and Hollywood, the film’s creative team includes Kushner, who also serves as an executive producer; Tony Award® winner Justin Peck, who choreographed the musical numbers in the film; renowned Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor and GRAMMY Award® winner Gustavo Dudamel, who helmed the recording of the iconic score; Academy Award®-nominated composer and conductor David Newman (“Anastasia”), who arranged the score; Tony Award®-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (“Fun Home,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie”), who supervised the cast on vocals; and Grammy®-nominated music supervisor Matt Sullivan (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Chicago”), who served as executive music producer for the film.

Former Avenger Clint Barton has a seemingly simple mission: get back to his family for Christmas. Possible? Maybe with the help of Kate Bishop, a 22-year-old archer with dreams of becoming a Super Hero. The two are forced to work together when a presence from Barton’s past threatens to derail far more than the festive spirit. \n\nStarring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye and Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, “Hawkeye” also features Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James and newcomer Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez. Helmed by Rhys Thomas and directing duo Bert and Bertie, “Hawkeye” debuts exclusively on Disney+ on November 24, 2021.\n\nFollow Marvel on Twitter: ‪https://twitter.com/marvel\nLike Marvel on Facebook: ‪https://www.facebook.com/marvel\nWatch Marvel on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/marvel\n\nReward your Marvel fandom by joining Marvel Insider!\nEarn points, then redeem for awesome rewards.\nTerms and conditions apply. \nLearn more at https://www.marvel.com/insider?Osocial=YT&CID=MarvelInsider\n\nFor even more news, stay tuned to:\nTumblr: ‪http://marvelentertainment.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marvel\nPinterest: ‪http://pinterest.com/marvelofficial\nReddit: http://reddit.com/u/marvel-official","slug":"/youtube/5VYb3B1ETlk","title":"Marvel Studios’ Hawkeye | Official Trailer | Disney+","date":"September 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-13T21:21:39.682Z","datetime":"2021-09-13 21:21","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"5VYb3B1ETlk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYb3B1ETlk","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5VYb3B1ETlk/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYb3B1ETlk","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvC4D8onUfXzvjTOM-dBfEA","author":"Marvel Entertainment","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":798284,"views":15329858,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーベル・スタジオ『ホークアイ』｜公式予告編｜Disney+（ディズニープラス","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"漫威影业的《鹰眼》｜官方预告片｜迪士尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"漫威影業的《鷹眼》｜官方預告片｜迪士尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:z53JjZL5WsI","excerpt":"It was a rude awakening for the Texas Longhorns as they travelled to Fayetteville, Arkansas to face off with the Arkansas Razorbacks.

The Many Saints Of Newark, in theaters and streaming exclusively on HBO Max* October 1. Watch the new trailer now.\n\n*Only available on the Ad-Free plan, streaming in the US only for 31 days from its theatrical release.\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/newarkmovie \nhttps://twitter.com/NewarkMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/newarkmovie\nhttps://www.themanysaintsofnewarkmovie.com\n \nNew Line Cinema’s “The Many Saints of Newark” is the much-anticipated feature film prequel to David Chase’s groundbreaking, award-winning HBO drama series “The Sopranos.”\n \nYoung Anthony Soprano is growing up in one of the most tumultuous eras in Newark’s history, becoming a man just as rival gangsters begin to rise up and challenge the all-powerful DiMeo crime family’s hold over the increasingly race-torn city. Caught up in the changing times is the uncle he idolizes, Dickie Moltisanti, who struggles to manage both his professional and personal responsibilities—and whose influence over his nephew will help make the impressionable teenager into the all-powerful mob boss we’ll later come to know: Tony Soprano.\n \n“The Many Saints of Newark” stars Alessandro Nivola (“Disobedience,” “American Hustle”), Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. (Broadway’s “Hamilton,” “Murder on the Orient Express”), Jon Bernthal (“Baby Driver,” “The Wolf of Wall Street”), Corey Stoll (“First Man,” “Ant-Man”), Michael Gandolfini (TV’s “The Deuce”), Billy Magnussen (“Game Night,” “The Big Short”), Michela De Rossi (“Boys Cry,” TV’s “The Rats”), John Magaro (“The Finest Hours,” “Not Fade Away”), with Emmy winner Ray Liotta (TV’s “Shades of Blue,” “Goodfellas”) and Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (“Up in the Air,” “The Conjuring” films).\n \nAlan Taylor (“Thor: The Dark World”), who won an Emmy for his directing work on “The Sopranos,” is helming the film from a screenplay by series creator David Chase & Lawrence Konner, based on characters created by Chase.  Chase, Konner and Nicole Lambert are producing the film, with Michael Disco, Marcus Viscidi, Toby Emmerich and Richard Brener serving as executive producers.\n \nTaylor’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Kramer Morgenthau (“Creed II,” “Thor: The Dark World”), production designer Bob Shaw (“The Wolf of Wall Street,” “The Sopranos”), Oscar-nominated editor Christopher Tellefsen (“Moneyball,” “A Quiet Place”) and costume designer Amy Westcott (“The Wrestler,” “Black Swan”).\n \n“The Many Saints of Newark” was shot on location in New Jersey and New York, and several beloved characters from the original series that inspired the film are featured in the movie. During its six-season run, “The Sopranos”—widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television drama series of all time—was honored with 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and two Peabody Awards, to name only a portion.\n \nNew Line Cinema Presents, In Association with Home Box Office, a Chase Films Production, “The Many Saints of Newark.” The film is slated for release in theaters nationwide on October 1, 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release. It is being distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and has been rated R for strong violence, pervasive language, sexual content and some nudity.","slug":"/youtube/d9Em4ckh878","title":"THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK – Official Trailer 2","date":"September 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-08T23:23:42.397Z","datetime":"2021-09-08 23:23","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"d9Em4ckh878","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Em4ckh878","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/d9Em4ckh878/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Em4ckh878","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Rick and Morty season 5 has come to a close with probably the biggest season finale we’ve ever seen from the series.

The scale was massive, the storylines it followed up were the most desired, the back story reveals were incredibly thorough, and the cliffhanger left us with some of the biggest and most fascinating implications of any Rick and Morty story so far. So let’s dive in and not only talk about this finale, but season 5 as a whole and our expectations for season 6.

Naomi Osaka is the women’s singles defending champion and will be aiming to claim the title for the third time in four years. Meanwhile, No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic looks to complete the calendar Grand Slam after winning the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon already this year.

Or so we thought. \nIt turns out that there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death – and other viruses hunting them.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/3jmCXiR\nBandcamp https://bit.ly/3yh7Tp3\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nBBumbrazz, Sir Harry Farr, Abigail von Kelsch, Szabolcs Dombi, Conner Wilson, Enoch, Moody Bastard, Diego Marcheselli, Paxton LaRiviere, Richard Hagen, Robin Harn, Izzy Crow, Kristy Evangelista, Michael Baker, Tuna The Fish, @charlievankamp, Calvin Black, Justin Fisher, Jan Hübler, Anshul Choudhry, garshtoshteles, Mark Moses, Mau Magaña, seasar2000, Toda, newline, Matt, schubadu, Slumperd, Cracker, Josh Carpenter, Benedikt S., Jeti, Kevin Williams, Enrique Mejia, Juan Carlos Coto Sanchez, Paulmega, Jasmeet Singh, Austin Daily, Andrew Bourgeois, Andrew Dawson, Fin Brewin, Graesha Lizardo, Hagen, Diogo Moreno, Madeline McKinnon, akshay niranjan, The Entity, sontino catalano, Aubrey Temple, Terone, Oleksandr Bolgarov, Jacob Bell, Kyle Harmse, Henry Angulo, Luka Dulčić, mors741, Billyboots75, Joe Bedell, Merasmus 2.0, jimmy davies, PBYuki-Onna, Billy Z Duke","slug":"/youtube/1-NxodiGPCU","title":"This Virus Shouldn't Exist (But it Does)","date":"August 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-31T20:37:00.183Z","datetime":"2021-08-31 20:37","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"1-NxodiGPCU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NxodiGPCU","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1-NxodiGPCU/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NxodiGPCU","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q","author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":349032,"views":8380185,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"存在してはならないウイルス（しかし存在する","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这种病毒不应该存在（但它确实存在）。","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這種病毒不應該存在（但它確實存在）。","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:5wvATZb7-Eo","excerpt":"On Tuesday morning, just hours after the final US troop withdrawal that ended America’s longest war, Kabul airport is at a standstill.

FRIENDS!! So for a bit of a throwback video, this week I'm going to be showing you guys some long-lost footage from our East Asia trip in 2019, where we went shopping at 8 different vintage stores in 3 different countries. \n\nNow 2 years ago, we went on a trip to East Asia for three weeks, to visit Tokyo, Seoul, and Hong Kong to explore beauty & fashion trends, different shopping experiences, and cheese. \n\nAnd while we were there, I thought it would be cool to visit a couple of vintage clothing stores in each location to see how they compare to each other, as well as how they compare to vintage stores back in the US. And also of course to gather myself an international vintage clothing haul. What do you guys think??\n\nRinRin's channel: https://www.youtube.com/rinrindolljapan (English channel) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/RinRinDolly (Japanese channel)\nHojuSara's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/seoulsarang9095\nTinyTip's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg2NkfLad1SdlJ76zfUzKEw\nTaylor R's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TaylorR1488\n\nYou can find more from the stores here!\nKinsella - https://www.instagram.com/kinsellatokyo/ \nDog Harajuku - https://www.instagram.com/p/CTE4gIXpxWB/ \nPunk Cake - https://www.instagram.com/punk_cake/  \nHantage - https://www.instagram.com/hantage_official/ \nRing My Button - https://www.instagram.com/ringmybutton_official/ \nVintage Bonnie - https://www.instagram.com/vintage.bonnie/ \nMee & Gee - https://www.facebook.com/meegeeco (https://www.instagram.com/meegee_co/)\nMidwest Vintage - https://www.instagram.com/midwestvintage/  \n\nResources to learn more about what's been going on in Hong Kong -\nBBC articles about 2019 protests & beyond:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c95yz8vxvy8t/hong-kong-anti-government-protests\n\nVox borders videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG4vTyZ8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_RdnVtfZPY\n\nAlso, all of this footage was filmed in 2019, pre-lockdown, so that's why we are flying around & not wearing masks!

While there are tons of similarities to be found, subtle differences between the two could make a big difference in what happens in New Orleans.\n\nThe storm surge with Hurricane Ida is expected to be extreme and life-threatening.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.\nWith growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \n\nFollow Along\n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/\n►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/\n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial\n\nEdited By:\nBecky Johnson","slug":"/youtube/WtYyJdVac44","title":"Our Land Purchase","date":"August 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-26T15:35:44.895Z","datetime":"2021-08-26 15:35","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"WtYyJdVac44","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtYyJdVac44","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/WtYyJdVac44/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtYyJdVac44","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp0rRUsMDlJ1meYAQ6_37Dw","author":"Millennial Farmer","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":24146,"views":360278,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"土地の購入について","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们的土地购买","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們的土地購買","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:lOthvD1rMbQ","excerpt":"Commander Agryna knows firsthand the difference a Spartan can make—a difference never more important than now.

But Mr. Stockton suggests that unless government upholds its duty to protect Americans, keeping the common good in mind, this may be a battle with no end.\n\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

On the front cover it reads Peter Parker & His Spider-Minions with him puppeting people showing that the media is still sort of trashing him even though he saved the city and universe.\n\nGonna put some dirt in their eyes. It also shows that those around him have been pulled into this too which we'll talk about later on in the video.\n\nMJ reads one of the passages out about how some suggest Parker's powers include the ability to hypnotise females. Whilst this is thrown away as a little joke it actually foreshadows the big reveal in the trailer in which Peter asks Strange to pretty much hypnotise the entire world into forgetting he's Spider-man.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com","slug":"/youtube/Ee5R29872_U","title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs Explained & Things You Missed","date":"August 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-24T14:57:00.739Z","datetime":"2021-08-24 14:57","tags":["Spiderman","NoWayHome","Trailer","SpidermanNoWayHome","Marvel","MCU","DoctorStrange","GreenGoblin","WillemDafoe","DocOck","AlfredMolina","JamieFoxx","Electro","SinisterSix","PlotDetails","PlotLeak","MovieTrailer","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"Ee5R29872_U","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee5R29872_U","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Ee5R29872_U/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee5R29872_U","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":77510,"views":2755449,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown｜イースターエッグの説明と見逃したことについて","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"蜘蛛侠之路》官方预告片解读｜复活节彩蛋解读及你错过的事情","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蜘蛛俠之路》官方預告片解讀｜復活節彩蛋解讀及你錯過的事情","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:OlaOZaPYxtc","excerpt":"IT'S FINALLY HERE!
