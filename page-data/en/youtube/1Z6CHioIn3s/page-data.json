Without revealing the film's budget, Boosie said he called in favors for locations and said he didn't pay for anything in Baton Rouge. He also claimed he chose not to release the film through a major film company because he would've been stripped of his ownership and paid a relatively low fee. Despite filming the movie for about $250,000, Boosie said he profited nearly $1 million on the film's release date.
