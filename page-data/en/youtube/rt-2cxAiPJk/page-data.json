On the front cover it reads Peter Parker & His Spider-Minions with him puppeting people showing that the media is still sort of trashing him even though he saved the city and universe.\n\nGonna put some dirt in their eyes. It also shows that those around him have been pulled into this too which we'll talk about later on in the video.\n\nMJ reads one of the passages out about how some suggest Parker's powers include the ability to hypnotise females. Whilst this is thrown away as a little joke it actually foreshadows the big reveal in the trailer in which Peter asks Strange to pretty much hypnotise the entire world into forgetting he's Spider-man.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com","slug":"/youtube/Ee5R29872_U","title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown | Easter Eggs Explained & Things You Missed","date":"August 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SPIDERMAN No Way Home Official Trailer Breakdown｜イースターエッグの説明と見逃したことについて","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"蜘蛛侠之路》官方预告片解读｜复活节彩蛋解读及你错过的事情","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蜘蛛俠之路》官方預告片解讀｜復活節彩蛋解讀及你錯過的事情","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:q7VChbftTr0","excerpt":"In this video, Brad and Matt react to the final trailer for Marvel Studios Spider-Man No Way Home!\n\nThe movie stars Tom Holland, Zendaya, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Benedict Cumberbatch and many more.\n\n#Marvel #SpiderManNoWayHome #Reaction\n\nMy Social Media:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/therealsupes/\nhttps://twitter.com/therealsupes\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@supes?lang=en\n\nBrad's Channel: \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bradrlambert/\nhttps://twitter.com/bradrlambert\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/bradrlambert\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/bradrlambert\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@bradrlambert","slug":"/youtube/q7VChbftTr0","title":"SPIDER-MAN NO WAY HOME TRAILER REACTION!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 24, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"スパイダーマン ノーウェイ・ホーム」予告編の反響","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"蜘蛛人无路可归拖车反应!","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蜘蛛人無路可歸拖車反應!","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:rt-2cxAiPJk","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Ee5R29872_U","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:q7VChbftTr0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/youtube/rt-2cxAiPJk","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},
