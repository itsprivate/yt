your city \nThat’s better than mine\nAnd the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree\nAnd I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me\nHuh\n\nWell I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles\nYeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love\nOh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life\nAnd the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of\n\nBut now that we’re done and it’s over\nI bet you couldn’t believe \nWhen you realized I’m harder to forget\nThan I was to leave\nAnd I bet you think about me\n\nYou grew up in a silver spoon gated community\nGlamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills \nI was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion\nJust living room dancing and kitchen table bills\nBut you know what they say\nYou can’t help who you fall for \nAnd you and I fell like an early spring snow\nBut reality crept in, you said we’re too different\nYou laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes\n\nMr. Superior Thinking\nDo you have all the space that you need?\nI don’t have to be your shrink to know that\nYou’ll never be happy\nAnd I bet you think about me \n\nI bet you think about me, yes, I bet\nYou think about me\n\nOh, block it all out\nThe voices so loud saying \nWhy did you let her go\nDoes it make you feel sad \nThat the love that you’re looking for\nIs the love that you had\n\nNow you’re out in the world, searching for your soul\nScared not to be hip, scared to get old\nChasing make-believe status \nLast time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered\nCause you were with me\n\nBut now that we’re done and it’s over\nI bet it’s hard to believe\nBut it turned out I’m harder to forget \nThan I was to leave \nAnd, yeah, I bet you think about me\n\nI bet you think about me, yes\nI bet you think about me  \nI bet you think about me when you’re out \nAt your cool indie music concerts every week\nI bet you think about me in your house\nWith your organic shoes and your million dollar couch\nI bet you think about me when you say “oh my god\nShe’s insane, she wrote a song about me”\nI bet you think about me \n\n#taylorswift #ibetyouthinkaboutmetaylorsversion #redtaylorsversion\n\n\nMusic video by Taylor Swift performing I Bet
