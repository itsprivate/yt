(https://youtu.be/59W503UoFpI) And what better way to ring in the occasion than by spending 24 hours in it!! With the help of Andrew, @Hunter Kowald, Matt Braeden and Bailey Bagles Payne, Carer was able to get dry pillows, dry blankets, curtains, Wi-Fi and even Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwiches and Chick-Fil-A chicken nuggets delivered to him under water!! Talk about great delivery, 4 stars for sure, maybe even 5. We even flew a drone down inside the under water base, which may be a world's first to fly a drone under water?! This was one of the craziest engineering challenges yet. Nobody does it quite like Team RAR, and at the very least I think SpongeBob SquarePants in real life would be proud!!
