Brought to you by Raycon.\n\nHalo Infinite has officially launched but even though it has been 6 years since the release of Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is STILL making the same mistakes. It is mind-boggling how I even have to talk about and discuss this stuff. \n\nI saw a post on reddit that did a great job of explaining why there aren’t more modes in Halo Infinite and why you can’t choose what modes you play. If you have an Oddball challenge, then you have to queue and wait until you get an Oddball match to try and complete. It could be argued that the lack of modes/playlists is by design to FURTHER lengthen the time it takes to complete challenges.\n\nHalo 5 launched with so little content because (in my opinion) it encouraged people to play Warzone, the game mode designed around loot boxes and overpowered weapons. \n\nSo again, the fucking monetization is responsible for yet ANOTHER Halo games abysmal variety of content at release\n\n\nSUPPORT the Channel ► https://www.patreon.com/TheActMan \n\n____TIME STAMPS____\nIntroduction – 0:00 \nDisappointing News – 4:03\nLack of Content – 7:23\nGame Modes & Playlists – 11:08 \nCustom Games are Broken – 20:05\nFinal Thoughts – 28:33\n\n✪ CONNECT WITH ME ✪ \nSubscribe ↪ https://www.youtube.com/c/TheActMan?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter ➤ https://twitter.com/TheActMan_YT \nAct Man TV ➤ http://bit.ly/2kPXk7f  \n\nDiscord ➤ https://discord.gg/yBABtkh  \nInstagram ➤ https://www.instagram.com/theactman_yt/ \nXbox Live Gamertag ➤ The Act Man","slug":"/youtube/ARNBtGn70ww","title":"Halo Infinite Is Underwhelming & Disappointing...
