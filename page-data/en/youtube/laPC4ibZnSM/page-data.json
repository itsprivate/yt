At a bar, some random guy was pretending to be Luke Skywalker, using it to get free drinks and impress everyone there. He told them he was the best pilot in the galaxy, attempting to convince the crowd to employ him to do smuggling jobs. However, out of the shadows, a dark figure appeared. Towering over him, Vader asked him if he claimed the name of skywalker. Now gripped in a force choke, the man tried to explain that he wasn't actually Luke Skywalker. He responded in a very Vader like way, telling him that by tomorrow, no one will even remember he lived. Vader then told the onlookers that anyone who claims the name of Skywalker also claims his crimes and will result in their death. \n\n#darthvader #lukeskywalker #vader #starwarscomics #starwarslegends #starwarslore #starwarsexplained #starwars  #starwarsshorts #vadersfortress #shorts","slug":"/youtube/-PwfZcU-LQI","title":"What Happened When Vader Discovered A Luke Skywalker Imposter? #shorts","date":"October 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ルーク・スカイウォーカーの偽者をベイダーが発見したとき、何が起こったのか？#ショートパンツ","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当维德发现天行者卢克的冒牌货时发生了什么？#短裤","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當維德發現天行者盧克的冒牌貨時發生了什麼？#短褲","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:wNVHLe8qgzw","excerpt":"G.U.I.D.O PLUSHIES ARE OUT NOW!: https://fanfiber.com/collections/checkpoint/products/g-u-i-d-o-plushie\n\nFrom birth to death, this is 99 years in Squid Game - an entire life in the GTA 5 Dimension!
