\nBut somethin bout it felt like home somehow \nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister’s house \nAnd you’ve still got it in your drawer even now \nOh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze \nWe’re singing in the car getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place \nAnd I can picture it after all these days \nAnd I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more \nAnd I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…\n\nCause there we are again on that \nLittle town street \nYou almost ran the red \nCause you were looking over at me \nWind in my hair, I was there \nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter \nYour cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses\nin a twin-sized bed \nAnd your mother’s telling stories bout you on \nthe tee ball team \nYou taught me bout your past \nThinkin your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys \n‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground\nWe were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down\nAny time now, he’s gonna say it’s love\nYou never called it what it was\ntil we were dead and gone and buried \nCheck the pulse and come back \nSwearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to\nAs I reached for you but\nAll I felt was shame\nAnd you held my lifeless frame \nAnd I know it’s long gone and \nThere was nothing else I could do \nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to… \n\nCause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe’re dancin round the kitchen in the \nrefrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well…\nAnd there we are again \nWhen nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret\nBut I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we’d swear \nto remember it all too well \n\nWell maybe we got lost in translation \nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\nTil you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again \nJust to break me like a promise \nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest \nI’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\nCause I remember it all, all, all \nThey say all’s well that ends well\nBut I’m in a new hell every time\nYou double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age\nMaybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die.\n\nThe idea you had of me\nWho was she?\nA never-needy, ever lovely jewel\nWhose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened\nYou.\nThat’s what happened: You.\nYou, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you were on a late night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door \nall night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… \nTurning 21” \n\nTime won’t fly\nIt’s like I’m paralyzed by it \nI’d like to be my old self again\nBut I’m still trying to find it \nAfter plaid shirt days \nAnd nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things \nAnd I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf\nFrom that very first week\nCause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me \nYou can’t get rid of it\nCause you remember it all too well\n\nCause there we are again when\nI loved you so \nBack before you lost the one real thing\nYou’ve ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there \nYou remember it all \nDown the stairs, you were there \nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes \nBut the punchline goes:\n“I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\nCause in this city’s barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us did the love affair maim you \nAll too well\nJust between us, do you remember it \nAll too well\nJust between us, I remember it all too well\n\nWind in my hair \nI was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI was there\nSacred prayer\nI was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nAll too well
