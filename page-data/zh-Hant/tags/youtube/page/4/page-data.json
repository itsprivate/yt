Blaster bolts brightness made covert operations very difficult, even for the most skilled bounty hunters and military personnel. The Empire wished to conduct secretive assassinations, and therefore developed the nightstinger rifle. It could only fire 3-5 shots before the blaster gas canister needed replacing, with each canister costing around 1000 credits. However, the blaster bolts were completely invisible, allowing for stealthy assassinations. This was particularly useful when used in conjunction with a redirection crystal. When the invisible bolt was fired at the crystal it would redirect the bolt while also adding colouration, allowing the empire to frame unsuspecting citizens for their brutal exterminations. \n\n#blaster #blasters #starwarsweapons #starwarscomics #starwarslegends #starwarslore #starwarsexplained #starwars  #starwarsshorts #vadersfortress #shorts","slug":"/youtube/lHQ6lbLFQCg","title":"What Was The Illegal Blaster Rifle That Fired Invisible Blaster Bolts? #shorts","date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T23:30:33.772Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 23:30","tags":["blaster","blasters","starwarsweapons","starwarscomics","starwarslegends","starwarslore","starwarsexplained","starwars","starwarsshorts","vadersfortress","shorts","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"lHQ6lbLFQCg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHQ6lbLFQCg","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lHQ6lbLFQCg/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHQ6lbLFQCg","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChFDOD4WPd2FgTCkSA4qzXg","author":"Vader's Fortress","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":91363,"views":1081359,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"目に見えないブラスターボルトを発射する、違法なブラスターライフルとは何だったのか？#ショートパンツ","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"发射隐形冲击波的非法冲击波步枪是什么？#短裤","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"發射隱形衝擊波的非法衝擊波步槍是什麼？#短褲","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:KT18KJouHWg","excerpt":"Your genetic code is probably already in a database, without you ever giving a sample or permission.

The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n#ColdplayXBTS #MyUniverse #Coldplay #BTS #MusicOfTheSpheres","slug":"/youtube/3YqPKLZF_WU","title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Video)","date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T14:22:51.899Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 14:22","tags":["ColdplayXBTS","MyUniverse","Coldplay","BTS","MusicOfTheSpheres","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"3YqPKLZF_WU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YqPKLZF_WU","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3YqPKLZF_WU/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YqPKLZF_WU","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPM_n1atn2ijUwHd0NNRQw","author":"Coldplay","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":3430563,"views":19691884,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Video)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"冷酷乐队X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方视频","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"冷酷樂隊X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方視頻","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:bl-ABuxeWrE","excerpt":"John Oliver dives into the tense and competitive world of duck stamps.\n\nConnect with Last Week Tonight online... \n\nSubscribe to the Last Week Tonight YouTube channel for more almost news as it almost happens: www.youtube.com/lastweektonight \n\nFind Last Week Tonight on Facebook like your mom would: www.facebook.com/lastweektonight \n\nFollow us on Twitter for news about jokes and jokes about news: www.twitter.com/lastweektonight \n\nVisit our official site for all that other stuff at once: www.hbo.com/lastweektonight","slug":"/youtube/bl-ABuxeWrE","title":"Duck Stamps: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)","date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T14:22:51.899Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 14:22","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"bl-ABuxeWrE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl-ABuxeWrE","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bl-ABuxeWrE/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl-ABuxeWrE","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ","author":"LastWeekTonight","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":62901,"views":1527979,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アヒルの切手 ラスト・ウィーク・トゥナイト・ウィズ・ジョン・オリバー(HBO)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"鸭子邮票。约翰-奥利弗的《今晚最后一周》（HBO）。","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"鴨子郵票。約翰-奧利弗的《今晚最後一週》（HBO）。","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:gXH7_XaGuPc","excerpt":"Listen to Last One Standing, from the film Venom: Let There Be Carnage\nhttps://VenomCarnage.lnk.to/LastOneStanding\n \nhttp://eminem.com\nhttp://facebook.com/eminem  \nhttp://twitter.com/eminem\nhttp://instagram.com/eminem\nhttp://eminem.tumblr.com\n \nhttp://shadyrecords.com\nhttp://facebook.com/shadyrecords\nhttp://twitter.com/shadyrecords\nhttp://instagram.com/shadyrecords\nhttp://trustshady.tumblr.com   \n \n#SkylarGrey #PoloG #Mozzy #Eminem #VenomCarnage #LastOneStanding\n\nMusic video by Skylar Grey, Polo G, Mozzy, Eminem performing Last One Standing (Audio). © 2021 Aftermath Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/UnJl4I","slug":"/youtube/gXH7_XaGuPc","title":"Skylar Grey - Last One Standing ft.

In this breakdown we're gonna be giving a big recap of the entire thing before going into what could be happening in the finale next.\n\nNow what is a spoiler filled breakdown if not just a spoiler free one persevering? I really dunno but if you haven't had a chance to check out the episode then I suggest you check out now. Make sure you like the video and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss next weeks breakdown as we will of course be talking about the finale.\n\nWith that out the way thanks for clicking this, now let's get into What If.\n\nOk so last weeks episode ended with the biggest party pooper of them all arriving on the scene. Ultron had arrived and with him he brought not only his Iron Legion of Ultron Bots but also the Infinity Stones and Vision's face.\n\nI forgot to point out last time that the way that the mask opened up was clearly a nod to Tony Stark's Iron Man one in reverse. Tony actually of course helped to build Ultron in the MCU and because of this it took on several of his personality traits.\n\nThese included his speech patterns and sayings and one of them even triggered Kalue into realising who made him. However it actually went far beyond that and in the movie both the characters struggled over the word children.\n\nI absolutely love details like this and the episode should sort of be seen as Visions revenge for all those times that he died...which was a lot...it was a lot wasn't it.\n\nNow the episode basically reframes Avengers Age Of Ultron and it asks what would have happened had Ultron won. In the film he attempts to shift his consciouness into Vision's body and had he achieved this then the character would have been almost indestructible. Whilst there are several callbacks to that film there's also some nods to Wandavision and other films involving killer machines.\n\nMusic By Lakey Inspired\n» Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lakeyinspired\n» Spotify: https://goo.gl/aLkwM5\n» SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n» Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lakeyinspired/\n» SnapChat: Lakeyinspired","slug":"/youtube/NSgcvI3CYDQ","title":"Marvel WHAT IF Episode 8 Breakdown & Ending Explained Spoiler Review | Easter Eggs & Ultron Theories","date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T11:18:45.430Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 11:18","tags":["WhatIf","EasterEggs","EndingExplained","MarvelsWhatIf","Marvel","MCU","Ultron","PartyThor","CaptainMarvel","CaptainCarter","Episode8","Trailer","Spiderman","NoWayHome","IronMan","CaptainAmerica","PostCreditsScene","TChalla","Thanos","StarLord","IronMan","Thor","Loki","Hulk","AntMan","DoctorStrange","Killmonger","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"NSgcvI3CYDQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgcvI3CYDQ","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/NSgcvI3CYDQ/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgcvI3CYDQ","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3hT5JPPKy87JGbDls_5BQ","author":"Heavy Spoilers","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":17889,"views":504584,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーベル WHAT IF 第8話の内訳と結末の解説 ネタバレ感想｜イースターエッグとウルトロン説","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"漫威《假如》第8集剧情分解和结局解释 扰乱评论|复活节彩蛋和奥创理论","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"漫威《假如》第8集劇情分解和結局解釋 擾亂評論|復活節彩蛋和奧創理論","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:q8O-0zZn6_w","excerpt":"Watch the birth of Carnage in this exclusive extended sneak peek from VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE – exclusively in movie theaters tomorrow.

Without revealing the film's budget, Boosie said he called in favors for locations and said he didn't pay for anything in Baton Rouge. He also claimed he chose not to release the film through a major film company because he would've been stripped of his ownership and paid a relatively low fee. Despite filming the movie for about $250,000, Boosie said he profited nearly $1 million on the film's release date.

The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n#ColdplayXBTS #MyUniverse","slug":"/youtube/THpDRLWaL-I","title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Acoustic Version)","date":"September 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-27T14:59:32.563Z","datetime":"2021-09-27 14:59","tags":["ColdplayXBTS","MyUniverse","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"THpDRLWaL-I","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THpDRLWaL-I","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/THpDRLWaL-I/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THpDRLWaL-I","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPM_n1atn2ijUwHd0NNRQw","author":"Coldplay","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":871343,"views":4296303,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Acoustic Version)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"冷酷乐队X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方原声版","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"冷酷樂隊X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方原聲版","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:fJjVwCCYU3s","excerpt":"Bryson DeChambeau drove the first green and holed the eagle putt during his Sunday singles match against Sergio Garcia at the 2020 Ryder Cup.\n\nDon't miss a moment of the Ryder Cup!

Who’s in? Cowboy Bebop arrives Nov. 19.\n\nCOWBOY BEBOP is an action-packed space Western about three bounty hunters, aka “cowboys,” all trying to outrun the past. As different as they are deadly, Spike Spiegel (John Cho), Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), and Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda) form a scrappy, snarky crew ready to hunt down the solar system’s most dangerous criminals — for the right price. But they can only kick and quip their way out of so many scuffles before their pasts finally catch up with them.\n\nBased on the beloved anime series, COWBOY BEBOP is executive produced by André Nemec, Jeff Pinkner, Josh Appelbaum and Scott Rosenberg of Midnight Radio, Marty Adelstein and Becky Clements of Tomorrow Studios, Makoto Asanuma, Shin Sasaki and Masayuki Ozaki of Sunrise Inc., Tim Coddington, Tetsu Fujimura, Michael Katleman, Matthew Weinberg, and Christopher Yost. Nemec serves as showrunner. Original anime series director Shinichirō Watanabe is a consultant on the series, and original composer Yoko Kanno returns for the live-action adaptation.

But this reveal is bitter-sweet because while Team RAR will be moving on to an awesome new house, it means we're having to leave the awesome Team RAR mansion in Los Angeles. We've made a lot of incredible memories and great videos in this house, from the world-record trampoline tower stack, to an entire Lego city, to countless 100 button mystery box challenges and tons of Last to Leave videos for insane prizes like Lamborghinis or $10,000. This house has been good to us (despite the occasional attic hauntings), but now it's time to start a new chapter for Team RAR. What would you like to see next??

They’re not too common out in the wasteland, are expensive beyond belief, and your Power Armor is worthless without them. But more importantly you can use them to turn nuclear waste into an actual weapon which naturally brings up an important question: Can You Beat Fallout 4 With Only Ejected Fusion Cores?\n\nMitten Squad Discord: \n\nCheck out some of my other videos if you liked this one:\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas With A Big Iron On Your Hip?: https://youtu.be/K_x9akvgc40\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas By Killing Everyone?:  https://youtu.be/7mCJBotRYeg\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/BlMwqo4rAHg\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas As A Necromancer?: https://youtu.be/kfQ6GNKqLOs\nCan You Beat Fallout 4 Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/k0GamZYQwvA\nCan You Beat Fallout 3 Without Moving The Camera?: https://youtu.be/kUpwvr4YlD4\nCan You Beat Skyrim With Only A Fork?: https://youtu.be/pBVBrUXGpWk\nCan You Beat Skyrim With Only Telekinesis? https://youtu.be/9OVWJWLzL14 \nCan You Beat Fallout 4 With Legendary Weapons? https://youtu.be/Jmi5trYwggM\n\nCan You Beat Fallout 4 With Only Ejected Fusion Cores? (in text form)\n\nIf you haven’t dug deep under the intelligence perk tree in Fallout 4 you’d never know that Rank 3 of the Nuclear Physicist perk lets you eject Fusion Cores from your Power Armor as a sort of timed grenade. Nuclear Physicist itself requires Intelligence of 9 and it also requires you to be level 26 so before you can unlock it so step 1 in my adventure to cleanse the wasteland with nuclear leftovers was to get to level 26 without attacking anything. I won’t overhype it. I’ll be nice and call it a learning experience. \n\nThe real game begins with very minor tweaks to create the perfect man and the assigning of SPECIAL points. As I said, Intelligence needs to be at 9. Perception at 4 lets me take the Lockpicking perk, Endurance at 7 because I’m gonna be taking a lot of damage in the early game, Charisma o 3 for the Lone Wanderer perk and the rest are irrelevant. I named myself Shaun to amuse me, not you, there were fireworks, and as one door closed, another one opened. As for escaping the vault without attacking any of the roaches, it’s as easy as locking them behind the door and waiting for them to forget you existed. \n\nOut into the rest of Fallout 4, I headed home to get to work. In the past I’ve harvested the remnants of mother nature’s beauty to create a world of fences. After abusing that power for more than a year I learned that some settlement items can be crafted in place over and over again without moving. But there’s an actual exploit that drawrves everything I’ve done before. All around Sanctuary are items -trees, baby fences, houses, cars- that can be scrapped for their base components. You take these components alongside a few perks and craft wire fences or wood fences, any item that costs next to nothing to craft, craft as many as you can and you can be at level 4 or 5 before you leave Sanctuary. The difficulty in past videos has been obtaining enough components to create objects on a large enough scale that make it worth doing. But that problem dies today with the infamous item duplication glitch. Full disclosure I loosely followed SuperbTube’s video on getting this Fallout 4 infinite experience exploit 2021 to work properly. It feels impossible to get at first, then you get a nail it once, forget what your mentor just told you to do and make a mistake.

The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n#ColdplayXBTS #MyUniverse","slug":"/youtube/bZYPI4mYwhw","title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Lyric Video)","date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T12:59:49.139Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 12:59","tags":["ColdplayXBTS","MyUniverse","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"bZYPI4mYwhw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZYPI4mYwhw","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bZYPI4mYwhw/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZYPI4mYwhw","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPM_n1atn2ijUwHd0NNRQw","author":"Coldplay","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":4855120,"views":40234366,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Official Lyric Video)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"冷酷乐队X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方抒情视频","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"冷酷樂隊X BTS - 我的宇宙（官方抒情視頻","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:78oUN6QTKxI","excerpt":"WATCH ME LIVE ► https://www.twitch.tv/Mizkif\nfollow me on twitter ►https://www.twitter.com/realMizkif\nfollow me on instagram ► https://www.instagram.com/realmizkif/\njoin my subreddit ► https://old.reddit.com/r/mizkif\n\nVideo editing by Rosii:\nhttp://twitter.com/rosiiwun\n\nThumbnail by Laavka:\nhttps://twitter.com/Iaavka\n\nChannel Managed by Zedshan:\nhttps://twitter.com/Zeeshan_Khamis\n\n#mizkif","slug":"/youtube/78oUN6QTKxI","title":"I Lost Her","date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T11:29:07.645Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 11:29","tags":["mizkif","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"78oUN6QTKxI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78oUN6QTKxI","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/78oUN6QTKxI/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78oUN6QTKxI","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChl76B7zqfMcNzfMi9vJruw","author":"Mizkif","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":63051,"views":732180,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"I Lost Her","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我失去了她","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我失去了她","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:V16GdzRvhRU","excerpt":"The first 1000 people to use the link will get a one-month free trial of Skillshare Premium Membership: https://skl.sh/wendoverproductions09211 \n\nWatch Extremities at http://youtube.com/extremities\n\nBuy a Wendover Productions t-shirt: https://standard.tv/collections/wendover-productions/products/wendover-productions-shirt\n\nSubscribe to Half as Interesting (The other channel from Wendover Productions): https://www.youtube.com/halfasinteresting\n\nYoutube: http://www.YouTube.com/WendoverProductions\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/sam.from.wendover\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/WendoverPro\nSponsorship Enquiries: wendover@standard.tv\nOther emails: sam@wendover.productions\nReddit: http://Reddit.com/r/WendoverProductions\n\nWriting by Sam Denby\nResearch by Sam Denby and Tristan Purdy\nEditing by Alexander Williard\nAnimation by Josh Sherrington\nSound by Graham Haerther \nThumbnail by Simon Buckmaster","slug":"/youtube/V16GdzRvhRU","title":"Saudi Arabia's Oil Problem","date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T07:31:12.372Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 07:31","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"V16GdzRvhRU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16GdzRvhRU","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/V16GdzRvhRU/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V16GdzRvhRU","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ","author":"Wendover Productions","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":38626,"views":900797,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サウジアラビアの石油問題","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"沙特阿拉伯的石油问题","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沙特阿拉伯的石油問題","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:DDOL5gJ4tIM","excerpt":"Watch as NikkieTutorials gets ready for the Met Gala 2021.

Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.","slug":"/youtube/IbWXedlPSVo","title":"Quando Rondo - Who Can I Trust (Official Video)","date":"September 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-22T23:36:34.637Z","datetime":"2021-09-22 23:36","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"IbWXedlPSVo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbWXedlPSVo","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IbWXedlPSVo/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbWXedlPSVo","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLr1r2bBAwBPG3KJubtYyyg","author":"Quando Rondo","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":36390,"views":531416,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Quando Rondo - Who Can I Trust (Official Video)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"昆多-隆多-我可以信任谁（官方视频","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"昆多-隆多-我可以信任誰（官方視頻","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:RS9jRyYFFQM","excerpt":"ill just take the next one #shorts","slug":"/youtube/RS9jRyYFFQM","title":"POV: You Enter The Elevator","date":"September 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-22T22:42:58.233Z","datetime":"2021-09-22 22:42","tags":["shorts","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"RS9jRyYFFQM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS9jRyYFFQM","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/RS9jRyYFFQM/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS9jRyYFFQM","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-79UOlP48-QNGgCko5p2g","author":"MrBeast Shorts","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":113326,"views":1490681,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"POVです。エレベータに乗る","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"观点。你进入电梯","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"觀點。你進入電梯","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:yiw6_JakZFc","excerpt":"This video was supported by Gates Notes, the personal blog of Bill Gates, where he writes about global health, climate change, and more.

And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. \n\nSo why don’t we just like… prevent all of that?

I will contact you to arrange a time and location.\"\n\nThe FBI had already said it believed the remains found Sunday in Bridger Teton National Forest, on the eastern edge of Grand Teton National Park, were Petito's. A mysterious stone cross was discovered in the campground where the body was found.\n\nTheir biggest question right now: Where is Brian Laundrie?\n\nPolice in North Port, Florida, Laundrie's hometown, launched a renewed search for him in the 25,000-acre Carlton Preserve on Tuesday, a day after they said they were suspending the effort because they believed they had exhausted all avenues. They started searching early in the day.

Carson Daly returns as host. The show's innovative format features four stages of competition: Blind Auditions, Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and Live Performance Shows.\n\nThis season's Battle Advisors include Jason Aldean (Team Kelly), Kristin Chenoweth (Team Ariana), Camila Cabello (Team Legend), and Dierks Bentley (Team Blake). For the Knockouts, one superstar Mega Mentor will work with all the coaches and their teams.\n\nIn the Live Performance Shows, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast, and the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n\nGymani Kills It, Singing Ariana Grande's \"pov\" in Front of Ariana | The Voice Blind Auditions 2021\nhttps://youtu.be/1AfIlOSDBLA\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","slug":"/youtube/1AfIlOSDBLA","title":"Gymani Kills It, Singing Ariana Grande's \"pov\" in Front of Ariana | The Voice Blind Auditions 2021","date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T22:06:30.798Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 22:06","tags":["TheVoice2021","TheVoice","NBC","ArianaGrande","BlakeShelton","JohnLegend","KellyClarkson","Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"1AfIlOSDBLA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfIlOSDBLA","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/1AfIlOSDBLA/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfIlOSDBLA","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdK1NLHxEUGXc1gq2NxkTw","author":"The Voice","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":85294,"views":2129731,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Gymani Kills It、アリアナ・グランデの「pov」をアリアナの前で歌う｜The Voice Blind Auditions 2021","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"吉玛尼杀出重围，当着阿丽亚娜-格兰德的面唱《pov》|2021年好声音盲选赛","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"吉瑪尼殺出重圍，當着阿麗亞娜-格蘭德的面唱《pov》|2021年好聲音盲選賽","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:2YGGXrFv4GI","excerpt":"Unboxing the all new iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max is here!\nCheck out my full iPhone 13 Camera test / review: https://youtu.be/UCv6L0IDVcA\nWatch my Tim Cook Interview: https://youtu.be/UU6MtPwT_5c\n► SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE VIDEOS: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ijustine\n🎶 MUSIC I USE - http://share.epidemicsound.com/NNNGs\n\nBE MY FRIEND:\nhttp://instagram.com/ijustine\nhttp://facebook.com/ijustine\nhttp://twitter.com/ijustine\nSnapchat: iJustine\n\n► WHAT I USE TO MAKE VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRCngWau2GE\n\n📷 GEAR:\nSony a7 III: http://geni.us/UHuO6A\nSony a7S II: http://geni.us/B1tYeKZ\nFE 24-70mm F2.8 GM Lens: http://geni.us/MhAPNE\nRx100 V: http://geni.us/ZVGoJ\nGoPro Hero 7: http://geni.us/uxuU1\nInsta 360 One X: http://geni.us/8tEtxK\nRx0: http://geni.us/BoXwFGr\nMemory Card: http://geni.us/zuulPoA\n\nBECOME A CHANNEL MEMBER: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey_c7U86mJGz1VJWH5CYPA/join","slug":"/youtube/2YGGXrFv4GI","title":"iPhone 13 | Unboxing all new models!","date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T22:06:30.798Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 22:06","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"2YGGXrFv4GI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YGGXrFv4GI","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2YGGXrFv4GI/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YGGXrFv4GI","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey_c7U86mJGz1VJWH5CYPA","author":"iJustine","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":41045,"views":946083,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"iPhone 13｜新モデルをすべて開封！？","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"iPhone 13 | 开箱的所有新机型!","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"iPhone 13 | 開箱的所有新機型!","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:84FatKnHhJI","excerpt":"Unboxing iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, including camera test, battery, specs etc!

This reimagining of the beloved musical stars Ansel Elgort (Tony); Rachel Zegler (María); Ariana DeBose (Anita); David Alvarez (Bernardo); Mike Faist (Riff); Josh Andrés Rivera (Chino); Ana Isabelle (Rosalía); Corey Stoll (Lieutenant Schrank); Brian d’Arcy James (Officer Krupke); and Rita Moreno (as Valentina, who owns the corner store in which Tony works). Moreno – one of only three artists to be honored with Academy®, Emmy®, GRAMMY®, Tony® and Peabody Awards – also serves as one of the film’s executive producers.\n \nBringing together the best of both Broadway and Hollywood, the film’s creative team includes Kushner, who also serves as an executive producer; Tony Award® winner Justin Peck, who choreographed the musical numbers in the film; renowned Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor and GRAMMY Award® winner Gustavo Dudamel, who helmed the recording of the iconic score; Academy Award®-nominated composer and conductor David Newman (“Anastasia”), who arranged the score; Tony Award®-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (“Fun Home,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie”), who supervised the cast on vocals; and Grammy®-nominated music supervisor Matt Sullivan (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Chicago”), who served as executive music producer for the film.

Former Avenger Clint Barton has a seemingly simple mission: get back to his family for Christmas. Possible? Maybe with the help of Kate Bishop, a 22-year-old archer with dreams of becoming a Super Hero. The two are forced to work together when a presence from Barton’s past threatens to derail far more than the festive spirit. \n\nStarring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye and Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, “Hawkeye” also features Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James and newcomer Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez. Helmed by Rhys Thomas and directing duo Bert and Bertie, “Hawkeye” debuts exclusively on Disney+ on November 24, 2021.\n\nFollow Marvel on Twitter: ‪https://twitter.com/marvel\nLike Marvel on Facebook: ‪https://www.facebook.com/marvel\nWatch Marvel on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/marvel\n\nReward your Marvel fandom by joining Marvel Insider!\nEarn points, then redeem for awesome rewards.\nTerms and conditions apply. \nLearn more at https://www.marvel.com/insider?Osocial=YT&CID=MarvelInsider\n\nFor even more news, stay tuned to:\nTumblr: ‪http://marvelentertainment.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marvel\nPinterest: ‪http://pinterest.com/marvelofficial\nReddit: http://reddit.com/u/marvel-official","slug":"/youtube/5VYb3B1ETlk","title":"Marvel Studios’ Hawkeye | Official Trailer | Disney+","date":"September 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-13T21:21:39.682Z","datetime":"2021-09-13 21:21","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"5VYb3B1ETlk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYb3B1ETlk","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5VYb3B1ETlk/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYb3B1ETlk","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvC4D8onUfXzvjTOM-dBfEA","author":"Marvel Entertainment","authorUrl":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorImage":null,"authorSlug":null,"score":798284,"views":15329858,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーベル・スタジオ『ホークアイ』｜公式予告編｜Disney+（ディズニープラス","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"漫威影业的《鹰眼》｜官方预告片｜迪士尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"漫威影業的《鷹眼》｜官方預告片｜迪士尼+","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:z53JjZL5WsI","excerpt":"It was a rude awakening for the Texas Longhorns as they travelled to Fayetteville, Arkansas to face off with the Arkansas Razorbacks.

The Many Saints Of Newark, in theaters and streaming exclusively on HBO Max* October 1. Watch the new trailer now.\n\n*Only available on the Ad-Free plan, streaming in the US only for 31 days from its theatrical release.\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/newarkmovie \nhttps://twitter.com/NewarkMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/newarkmovie\nhttps://www.themanysaintsofnewarkmovie.com\n \nNew Line Cinema’s “The Many Saints of Newark” is the much-anticipated feature film prequel to David Chase’s groundbreaking, award-winning HBO drama series “The Sopranos.”\n \nYoung Anthony Soprano is growing up in one of the most tumultuous eras in Newark’s history, becoming a man just as rival gangsters begin to rise up and challenge the all-powerful DiMeo crime family’s hold over the increasingly race-torn city. Caught up in the changing times is the uncle he idolizes, Dickie Moltisanti, who struggles to manage both his professional and personal responsibilities—and whose influence over his nephew will help make the impressionable teenager into the all-powerful mob boss we’ll later come to know: Tony Soprano.\n \n“The Many Saints of Newark” stars Alessandro Nivola (“Disobedience,” “American Hustle”), Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. (Broadway’s “Hamilton,” “Murder on the Orient Express”), Jon Bernthal (“Baby Driver,” “The Wolf of Wall Street”), Corey Stoll (“First Man,” “Ant-Man”), Michael Gandolfini (TV’s “The Deuce”), Billy Magnussen (“Game Night,” “The Big Short”), Michela De Rossi (“Boys Cry,” TV’s “The Rats”), John Magaro (“The Finest Hours,” “Not Fade Away”), with Emmy winner Ray Liotta (TV’s “Shades of Blue,” “Goodfellas”) and Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (“Up in the Air,” “The Conjuring” films).\n \nAlan Taylor (“Thor: The Dark World”), who won an Emmy for his directing work on “The Sopranos,” is helming the film from a screenplay by series creator David Chase & Lawrence Konner, based on characters created by Chase.  Chase, Konner and Nicole Lambert are producing the film, with Michael Disco, Marcus Viscidi, Toby Emmerich and Richard Brener serving as executive producers.\n \nTaylor’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Kramer Morgenthau (“Creed II,” “Thor: The Dark World”), production designer Bob Shaw (“The Wolf of Wall Street,” “The Sopranos”), Oscar-nominated editor Christopher Tellefsen (“Moneyball,” “A Quiet Place”) and costume designer Amy Westcott (“The Wrestler,” “Black Swan”).\n \n“The Many Saints of Newark” was shot on location in New Jersey and New York, and several beloved characters from the original series that inspired the film are featured in the movie. During its six-season run, “The Sopranos”—widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television drama series of all time—was honored with 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and two Peabody Awards, to name only a portion.\n \nNew Line Cinema Presents, In Association with Home Box Office, a Chase Films Production, “The Many Saints of Newark.” The film is slated for release in theaters nationwide on October 1, 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release. It is being distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and has been rated R for strong violence, pervasive language, sexual content and some nudity.","slug":"/youtube/d9Em4ckh878","title":"THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK – Official Trailer 2","date":"September 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-08T23:23:42.397Z","datetime":"2021-09-08 23:23","tags":["Youtube"],"image":null,"imageAlt":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","thirdPartyId":"d9Em4ckh878","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Em4ckh878","originalUrl":null,"imageRemote":"https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/d9Em4ckh878/hqdefault.jpg","video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Em4ckh878","embed":null,"width":null,"height":null},"channel":null,"channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g","author":"Warner Bros.

Rick and Morty season 5 has come to a close with probably the biggest season finale we’ve ever seen from the series.

The scale was massive, the storylines it followed up were the most desired, the back story reveals were incredibly thorough, and the cliffhanger left us with some of the biggest and most fascinating implications of any Rick and Morty story so far. So let’s dive in and not only talk about this finale, but season 5 as a whole and our expectations for season 6.
