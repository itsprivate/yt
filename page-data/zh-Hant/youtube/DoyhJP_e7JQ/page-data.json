(https://youtu.be/Qoj5HPq5DSE) But today, we did one of the most difficult engineering challenges to date: Building a REAL Under Water House!! And we only had 7 days to do it or Andrew and Hunter would get SLIMED. Long-time Team RAR fans remember when we tried it the first time, and it (kind of) worked, but we were way too wet and it didn't last very long. Other channels have tried making an under water house, but we made the REAL THING and got Andrew, Bailey Bagles Payne, @Hunter Kowald , @FliplikeZ and @roloflow8 inside the house!! We took a cue from Sponge Bob Square Pants and Carer Sharer even added windows, hard wood floors, curtains, pillows and we even got Wi-Fi down there. This was insane. What do you think we should we do with the real Under Water House?? Should we rent it out to tenants in Los Angeles?
