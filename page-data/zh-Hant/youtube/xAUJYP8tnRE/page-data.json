Nick Cage in the action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. With a career built for this very moment, the seminal award-winning actor must take on the role of a lifetime: Nick Cage.","slug":"/youtube/I8VuWhvk87o","title":"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022 Movie) Official Red Band Teaser Trailer – Nicolas Cage","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 14, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"映画『アンビアン・ウェイト・オブ・マッシヴ』（2022年公開）公式レッドバンドティーザー予告編 - ニコラス・ケイジ","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"巨大的人才的不可承受之重（2022年电影）官方红带预告--尼古拉斯-凯奇","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"巨大的人才的不可承受之重（2022年電影）官方紅帶預告--尼古拉斯-凱奇","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:xAUJYP8tnRE","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:HfOSoVhe43k","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:I8VuWhvk87o","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/youtube/xAUJYP8tnRE","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
