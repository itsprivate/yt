The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. Gaining recognition for their authentic and self-produced music, top-notch performances, and the way they interact with their fans, BTS has established themselves as 21st century pop icons breaking countless world records. While imparting a positive influence through activities such as the LOVE MYSELF campaign and the UN ‘Speak Yourself’ speech, the band has mobilised millions of fans across the world (named ARMY), collected five No.1 Billboard Hot 100 singles in less than a year, performed multiple sold-out stadium shows across the world, and was named TIME’s Entertainer of the Year 2020. BTS has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the 63rd GRAMMY Awards and recognised with numerous prestigious awards like the Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n#ColdplayXBTS #MyUniverse #Coldplay #BTS #MusicOfTheSpheres #AMAs","slug":"/youtube/9L3aw9PfDpw","title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Live at the AMAs)","date":"November 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coldplay X BTS - My Universe (Live at the AMAs)","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"冷酷乐队X BTS - 我的宇宙（在AMAs的现场）","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"冷酷樂隊X BTS - 我的宇宙（在AMAs的現場）","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Hs3b4-vnWAk","excerpt":"","slug":"/youtube/Hs3b4-vnWAk","title":"GENIUS PEOPLE WHO BEAT THE SYSTEM!! #Shorts","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 22, 2021","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"システムを打ち破る天才たち!!! #ショートフィルム","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"天才的人，打败了系统！! #短裤","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"天才的人，打敗了系統！! #短褲","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:nMtrjNPcjR0","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:9L3aw9PfDpw","nextId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Hs3b4-vnWAk","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/youtube/nMtrjNPcjR0","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
