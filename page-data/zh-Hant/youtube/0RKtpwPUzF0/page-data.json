This includes that the Eternals were created by the Celestials in order to hunt predators known as the deviants.\n\nAccording to what they said, the Deviants basically feasted on newly formed evolving worlds that had a sudden burst in life and this explains why they show up after the snap.\n\nWe learn this from Ajak played by Salma Hayek who we open the trailer on. From the first trailer we know that the Eternals came to Earth millenia ago and that they helped us to evolve. Though this trailer doesn't confirm it it's likely that they travelled here in order to fight the deviants and after they decided to rest and look after us because we're so adorable aren't we. Got our wars but we got our memes as well.\n\nThis was heavily shown in the first trailer and though they spent centuries together I think it's safe to say that they decided to split up and live apart on the planet.\n\nHowever the threat of the deviants return brings them together and thus they have to team up once more. Now interestingly we don't see Ajak in any more present day scenes in the trailer.\n\nEverytime she shows up it seems to be in a flashback or a scene set in an earlier part of the timeline. This could mean that Ikarus kills her and later on in the trailer we see him at the location firing his eye lasers.\n\nI actually have a theory that Ikarus is bad and that he's angered over falling out of love with Sersi played by Gemma Chan. In the first look the pair were together for a long time but then they split up and it is rumoured that Sersi will now be dating Dane Whitman played by Kit Harrington.\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com","slug":"/youtube/psPafOd-LO4","title":"THE ETERNALS Final Trailer Breakdown, Easter Eggs, Things You Missed, Story Explained & Plot Leaks","date":"August 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"THE ETERNALS Final Trailer Breakdown, Easter Eggs, Things You Missed, Story Explained & Plot Leaks","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"永恒之城》最终预告片解析，复活节彩蛋，你错过的东西，故事解释和剧情泄露","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"永恆之城》最終預告片解析，復活節彩蛋，你錯過的東西，故事解釋和劇情泄露","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:mpjHqNWaiao","excerpt":"Check out our trailer reaction for the 'Eternals' final trailer!
