Here is a weird video we made where I melted every soap from Lush together into a few different batches of franken-soap!! This type of franken-experiment has worked well in the past across a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, candles, and bath bombs (also from Lush!) - and as some of you may know, over the years I have developed a bit of a soap fixation, having recreated a couple different soap art tutorials, as well as several bizarre soap art hacks from the internet. So I was excited to combine these two interests together by mixing every single soap from a single store to see what kind of soap bar we could whip up. What did you think of our final product??\n\nThanks to Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry and Katie at Royalty Soaps!
