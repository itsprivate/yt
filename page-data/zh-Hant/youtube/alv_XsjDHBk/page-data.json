They’re not too common out in the wasteland, are expensive beyond belief, and your Power Armor is worthless without them. But more importantly you can use them to turn nuclear waste into an actual weapon which naturally brings up an important question: Can You Beat Fallout 4 With Only Ejected Fusion Cores?\n\nMitten Squad Discord: \n\nCheck out some of my other videos if you liked this one:\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas With A Big Iron On Your Hip?: https://youtu.be/K_x9akvgc40\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas By Killing Everyone?:  https://youtu.be/7mCJBotRYeg\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/BlMwqo4rAHg\nCan You Beat Fallout: New Vegas As A Necromancer?: https://youtu.be/kfQ6GNKqLOs\nCan You Beat Fallout 4 Without A Pip-Boy?: https://youtu.be/k0GamZYQwvA\nCan You Beat Fallout 3 Without Moving The Camera?: https://youtu.be/kUpwvr4YlD4\nCan You Beat Skyrim With Only A Fork?: https://youtu.be/pBVBrUXGpWk\nCan You Beat Skyrim With Only Telekinesis? https://youtu.be/9OVWJWLzL14 \nCan You Beat Fallout 4 With Legendary Weapons? https://youtu.be/Jmi5trYwggM\n\nCan You Beat Fallout 4 With Only Ejected Fusion Cores? (in text form)\n\nIf you haven’t dug deep under the intelligence perk tree in Fallout 4 you’d never know that Rank 3 of the Nuclear Physicist perk lets you eject Fusion Cores from your Power Armor as a sort of timed grenade. Nuclear Physicist itself requires Intelligence of 9 and it also requires you to be level 26 so before you can unlock it so step 1 in my adventure to cleanse the wasteland with nuclear leftovers was to get to level 26 without attacking anything. I won’t overhype it. I’ll be nice and call it a learning experience. \n\nThe real game begins with very minor tweaks to create the perfect man and the assigning of SPECIAL points. As I said, Intelligence needs to be at 9. Perception at 4 lets me take the Lockpicking perk, Endurance at 7 because I’m gonna be taking a lot of damage in the early game, Charisma o 3 for the Lone Wanderer perk and the rest are irrelevant. I named myself Shaun to amuse me, not you, there were fireworks, and as one door closed, another one opened. As for escaping the vault without attacking any of the roaches, it’s as easy as locking them behind the door and waiting for them to forget you existed. \n\nOut into the rest of Fallout 4, I headed home to get to work. In the past I’ve harvested the remnants of mother nature’s beauty to create a world of fences. After abusing that power for more than a year I learned that some settlement items can be crafted in place over and over again without moving. But there’s an actual exploit that drawrves everything I’ve done before. All around Sanctuary are items -trees, baby fences, houses, cars- that can be scrapped for their base components. You take these components alongside a few perks and craft wire fences or wood fences, any item that costs next to nothing to craft, craft as many as you can and you can be at level 4 or 5 before you leave Sanctuary. The difficulty in past videos has been obtaining enough components to create objects on a large enough scale that make it worth doing. But that problem dies today with the infamous item duplication glitch. Full disclosure I loosely followed SuperbTube’s video on getting this Fallout 4 infinite experience exploit 2021 to work properly. It feels impossible to get at first, then you get a nail it once, forget what your mentor just told you to do and make a mistake. But that wasn’t my first mistake.","body":"Fusion Cores are some of the most sought after items in Fallout 4.
