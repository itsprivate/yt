The singer’s desire to develop rich musical and visual environments for her fans is job one, and this new album, her third after ‘Amala’ and ‘Hot Pink,’ is her most fully-realized statement yet. Doja has told interviewers that she wanted to take chances, try new approaches, and create “otherworldly” sounds. Job done. The same goes for our series of Official Live Performances. After sharing creative ideas with the singer and her team, our production crew got to work in a canyon outside of LA. There, assuring that “otherworldly” request was appropriately fleshed out, we built a 48’ stage in the center of a rocky crag. Doja, banking on a combo of skills, artistry, and perseverance, did the rest. We've already presented \"Love To Dream\" and \"Ain't Shit.\" Now comes the carnal coolness of \"Need To Know.\" Doja shows us her boss side as she drives all the action in this steamy bedroom rumination, and her lithe Cali desert performance makes it all pop.\n\nWatch music videos by Doja Cat: http://bit.ly/3azELOl\n\nDoja Cat\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DojaCat\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dojacat/\nhttp://www.dojacat.com/\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\n\nCreative Director: Micah Bickham\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham \nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nDirected By: Kyle Goldberg\nProducer: Madeline Schmidt\nProducer: Cole Brian \nProducer: Haley Sliger\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro & Jordan Ferree \nProduced By: Contrast Films\nDirector Of Photography: Franklin Ricart\nProduction Design: Wes Dogan \nDesign: Sydney Emery\nDesign: Dominique Falcone\nDesign: Keith Wright\nEditor : Kevin Rose\nVisual Effects: Sean Joseph \nColor: Justin Roberts\n\n#DojaCat  #DojaCatLive  #NeedToKnow\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/ihFhDn","body":"Doja Cat - Need To Know (Official Live Performance)  |  Vevo  \n\nSpend time roaming ‘Planet Her’ and you’ll know that Doja Cat’s artistic vision never sleeps.
