The unique event, previously called the Father/Son Challenge, will see a host of PGA TOUR and Champions Tour players compete alongside their children and parents over 36 holes, in a bid to win the Willie Park trophy. Last year’s victors, Justin and father Mike Thomas return to the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida, hoping to become the first back-to-back winners since Larry and Drew Nelson in 2008. After finishing seventh in last year’s event Tiger Woods and his son Charlie, now 12 years old, will be looking to once again challenge for the title. Other duos to look out for this weekend include Jim Furyk and son Tanner, Nick Faldo and son Matthew and Olympic Gold medalist and 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, Nelly Korda alongside her father Petr. In order to be eligible, participants must have either won a major championship or THE PLAYERS Championship. The competition adopts a scramble format, in which each player in the pairing tees off, with both participants then playing each subsequent shot from within a club length of where the best shot of the two lands.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/","slug":"/youtube/FVXzSgaMwU8","title":"Tiger and Charlie Woods shoot 10-under 62 | Round 1 | PNC Championship | 2021","date":"December 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"タイガー＆チャーリー・ウッズが10アンダーの62をマーク｜第1戦｜PNC選手権｜2021年","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"泰格和查理-伍兹打出低于标准杆10杆的62杆|第一轮|PNC锦标赛|2021年","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"泰格和查理-伍茲打出低於標準桿10杆的62杆|第一輪|PNC錦標賽|2021年","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:6PwEAQPcuVo","excerpt":"Find out the best remedy for skin tags and warts—and learn about the hidden cause of them!\n\nGet Dr. Berg’s Trace Minerals Here: \nhttps://shop.drberg.com/trace-minerals\n\nDATA:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1027811718300612 \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1027811718300612\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1027811718300612\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/EP1439845A1/en\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4674451/\n\n0:00 Introduction: How to rid skin tags and warts within 24 Hours\n0:22 What causes skin tags and warts? \n1:51 The best home remedy for skin tags and warts\n4:47 Key takeaways \n7:04 Thanks for watching\n\nIn this video, we’re going to talk about how to get rid of skin tags and warts within one day with a simple home remedy. \n\nWarts are caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV affects 325 million women worldwide. \n\nThere are over one hundred different types of HPV—14 of which can cause cancer. In fact, HPV can cause cervical cancer, and it is the 4th most common cause of cancer in women. \n\nViruses like HPV can hide out in the body until your immune system is compromised by stress, a health condition, or old age. \n\nThe best natural home remedies for skin tags and warts are:\n1. Povidone-iodine\n2. Fresh garlic\n\nHere’s how to use them:\nStep 1: Crush up garlic and put it in a dish\nStep 2: Place a couple of drops of povidone-iodine in another dish\nStep 3: Mix a small amount of garlic and garlic juice with the iodine\nStep 4: Apply the solution topically to your wart or skin tag\nStep 5: Cover the area with a bandaid \nStep 6: Save the iodine and garlic mixture to apply twice daily (mixture will stay good for one day)\n\nFor some, this remedy can work within a day—for others, it may take up to 8 weeks. \n\nKeep in mind that insulin resistance can make your body more susceptible to warts, so make sure you’re on Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting if you’re not already. Check out my keto playlist to learn about Health Keto and IF. \n\n50mg of zinc daily can also help fight off viruses that may cause warts.\n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nTalk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
