Captain Robert “Woody” Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. \n\nCaptain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning. After saluting the new flag he said that he was “flattered beyond comprehension” and that he was “really red, white, and blue”.","slug":"/youtube/-K96Dtxt0Ak","title":"Marines Surprise WWII Veteran","date":"December 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Youtube","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"海兵隊員、第二次世界大戦の退役軍人を驚かせる","description":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"海军陆战队给二战老兵带来惊喜","description":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"海軍陸戰隊給二戰老兵帶來驚喜","description":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"YoutubePost-yt:video:Ge0gLqCAX1Y","previousId":"YoutubePost-yt:video:-K96Dtxt0Ak","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/youtube/Ge0gLqCAX1Y","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
