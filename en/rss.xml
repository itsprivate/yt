From visionary filmmaker Lana Wachowski comes ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections,‚Äù the long-awaited next chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre. The new film reunites original stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the iconic roles they made famous, Neo and Trinity.

In ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections,‚Äù return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. And if Thomas‚Ä¶Neo‚Ä¶has learned anything, it‚Äôs that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of‚Äîor into‚Äî
the Matrix. Of course, Neo already knows what he has to do. But what he doesn‚Äôt yet know is the Matrix is stronger, more secure and more dangerous than ever before.  D√©j√† vu.

Reeves reprises the dual roles of Thomas Anderson/Neo, the man once saved from the Matrix to become the savior of humankind, who will once again have to choose which path to follow.
Moss portrays the iconic warrior Trinity‚Ä¶ or is she Tiffany, a suburban wife and mother of three with a penchant for superpowered motorcycles?

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (‚ÄúCandyman,‚Äù the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù franchise) plays the wise and worldly Morpheus who, as always, serves as a guide to Neo while also fulfilling his own greater purpose on a very singular journey of self-discovery.

Jessica Henwick (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúIron Fist,‚Äù ‚ÄúStar Wars: Episode VII ‚Äì The Force Awakens‚Äù) plays the hacker Bugs, the proverbial white rabbit on a mission to discover the one who sacrificed himself for humankind--and willing to take any risk necessary in search of the legend she idolizes.

Jonathan Groff (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindhunter‚Äù), plays Thomas Anderson‚Äôs business partner, a slick, confident corporate type with insouciant charm, a disarming smile and an eye on the bottom line--everything Mr. Anderson is not.

Neil Patrick Harris (‚ÄúGone Girl‚Äù) plays Thomas‚Äô therapist, working closely with his patient to understand the meaning behind his dreams and to distinguish them from reality.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuantico‚Äù) plays a young woman with a wisdom that belies her years and an ability to see the truth, no matter how murky the waters.

And Jada Pinkett Smith (‚ÄúAngel Has Fallen,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù) returns as Niobe, the fierce General who once fought for the survival of Zion and who now sees to the welfare of her people with a familiar fire in her eyes, despite a sense of disbelief and suspicion upon Neo‚Äôs return.

Lana Wachowski directed from a screenplay by Wachowski & David Mitchell & Aleksandar Hemon, based on characters created by The Wachowskis. The film was produced by James McTeigue, Lana Wachowski and Grant Hill. The executive producers were Garrett Grant, Terry Needham, Michael Salven, Karin Wachowski, Jesse Ehrman and Bruce Berman.

Wachowski‚Äôs creative team behind the scenes included ‚ÄúSense8‚Äù collaborators: directors of photography Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll, production designers Hugh Bateup and Peter Walpole, editor Joseph Jett Sally, costume designer Lindsay Pugh, visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, and composers Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer.

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents, In Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, In Association with Venus Castina Productions, ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections.‚Äù The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. It will be in theaters nationwide and on HBO Max via the Ad-Free plan on December 22, 2021; it will be available on HBO Max in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release.
‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections‚Äù is rated R for violence and some language.]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/nNpvWBuTfrc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/nNpvWBuTfrc</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 22:37:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Remember what is real.

There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my style. ‚ÄòPitbull‚Äô is always going to be on the attack,‚Äù said Cruz. ‚ÄúI think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.‚Äù
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis‚Äô ribs.
 
The 27-year-old Baltimore native turned on the power in the fourth, alternating between the right hook and left cross behind his southpaw stance. More punishing blows came from Davis during the fifth. 
 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a shorter fighter, so I was throwing down on the top of his head,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúI hit him with my knuckle and messed it up. I hurt my hand in the sixth round. No matter if the opponent is taller or shorter, I‚Äôve got to get through it. He‚Äôs a warrior. Even though he didn‚Äôt win, a star was born tonight.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIt was right around the fifth round I saw that his hand wasn‚Äôt working correctly,‚Äù Cruz observed. 
 
Davis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.
 
The 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight‚Äôs end. 
 
Naturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.
 
‚ÄúViva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,‚Äù he said.
 
Following a successful title defense, Davis said he‚Äôs ready for all comers.
 
‚ÄúL.A., we did it for Kobe,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the fight, he came on strong. I felt as the fight was going, he was breaking down. But I hurt my hand, so I wasn‚Äôt able to get him out of there.
 
‚ÄúWhatever the best opportunity is for me, I‚Äôll do it. All of them guys are easy work. I‚Äôm the top dog.‚Äù

Davis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.
 
The 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight‚Äôs end. 
 
Naturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.
 
‚ÄúViva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,‚Äù he said.
 
Following a successful title defense, Davis said he‚Äôs ready for all comers.
 
‚ÄúL.A., we did it for Kobe,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the fight, he came on strong. I felt as the fight was going, he was breaking down. But I hurt my hand, so I wasn‚Äôt able to get him out of there.
 
‚ÄúWhatever the best opportunity is for me, I‚Äôll do it. All of them guys are easy work. I‚Äôm the top dog.‚Äù

#Fortnite #FortniteChapter3 #FortniteFlipped</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 Flipped Overview Trailer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Watch the Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 Flipped trailer! 

The Fortnite Island has been flipped and a new one has been revealed.

Due to a particularly cold winter, the first thing you‚Äôll notice about the Island is that the western half‚Äôs a wintry biome. Perhaps stop by the suburban Greasy Grove, the industrial Logjam Lumberyard, and other locales.
Like warmer weather? To the east are the tropics, with coastal keys, palm trees, and weathered sights to see. Although The Seven have outposts all throughout the Island, the tropics are home to their home, the ‚ÄúSanctuary.‚Äù This compound is right next to the coast, where you can get a clear view of the colossal rock statue of The Foundation. And speaking of colossal, the towering, web-covered Daily Bugle building is also in the area.
Like even warmer weather? In the south you can find the desert (some of it decorated in snow), but this desert isn‚Äôt barren on interesting places. Go off-road racing at Chonker‚Äôs Speedway, revel in cozy living at Condo Canyon, and something that will wet even the driest eyes, ‚Äúcome on down‚Äù to the returning Butter Barn. 
A fresh slate of weapons awaits you on the Island. Here‚Äôs a rundown of what‚Äôs new!

Ranger Assault Rifle

Made for distance! The Ranger Assault Rifle is forceful at medium range and quite capable at long range. 

MK-Seven Assault Rifle
Built from The Seven‚Äôs technology, the MK-Seven Assault Rifle is a medium- to long-range weapon with a high rate of fire. This Assault Rifle has a sight you can use while aiming. Align your target with the sight‚Äôs red dot!
If you want something even better, confront The Foundation for a special version of the MK-Seven Assault Rifle, sporting a slightly faster fire rate. 

Striker Pump Shotgun
The Striker Pump Shotgun shoots a whole lot of pellets and boasts high burst damage. Aim‚Ä¶ then strike!

Auto Shotgun
An automatic ally that lays down some serious firepower. The Auto Shotgun may not deal as much damage as the Striker Pump per shot, but it has a faster fire rate and reloads two shells at a time.

Stinger SMG
Appropriately named, the Stinger SMG deals high damage to both opponents and structures. It stings at medium range more than one may expect!

Sidearm Pistol
A trusty weapon to have by your side, the Sidearm Pistol is an accurate weapon that deals high damage at medium range and high headshot damage at close range. Don‚Äôt underestimate it!

Hunter Bolt-Action Sniper
The Hunter Bolt-Action Sniper deals high damage and can shoot three shots per clip. Get a second chance if you don‚Äôt land your shot the first time! (And a third... just in case.)

I turned my friend into a Minecraft bee! He had to be by my side and help me fend off mobs attacking me but he could not break or place blocks. This was crazy fun...

I Hate You

SZA

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to mak–µ me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just lik–µ this?

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh yeah, ayy)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this?
