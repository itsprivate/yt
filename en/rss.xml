Jordan Evans and his son Gage were together when devastating storms and tornadoes hit western Kentucky late Friday night.

Gage was with his dad when the storm hit, but his mother and the rest of his family were right in the path of the storm. Their house didn't have a basement and there was no way to get below ground, except for one unique place just next door - a storm shelter, 10 feet down and 12 feet wide.

Ok so if you're here without seeing the movie and just wanna know whether the big leak was true or not then I'll just say uptop that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire are both in the film. Andrew is indeed the werewolf, we got to look at Tobey Maguire's d**k and I'm so glad that everyone who's been saying this for years can rest now. We can rest now. Beyond that though No Way Home has a number of big surprises in it and it's the most fun I've had in a theatre since Endgame. I am just gonna be calling them by their acting names as referring to them as Peter 1, 2 and 3 will get confusing but each one of them brings something special to the film.

The movie picks up immediately after the events of Far From Home with Peter's identity out there and he has to live with the reprecussions of his new found fame. They even got some of the actors back from that scene including this guy who shows up in both films. Nice.

Though his name is cleared by none other than Matt Murdock his life and the life of his friends has been ruined by the court of public opinion and their applications to MIT are rejected. The group can't get into any schools at all and it's clear that even though they didn't do anything wrong they've been cancelled.

Their lives are all ruined though and thus Peter goes to Doctor Strange in order erase this knowledge from everyone's mind so that his friends lives can have somewhat normality.]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/F0q6IslolVE</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/F0q6IslolVE</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 17:12:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>SPIDERMAN No Way Home Ending Explained | Full Movie Breakdown, Post Credits Scene &amp; Easter Eggs.

Zach Johnson, the “Millennial Farmer” is a 5th-generation farmer who’s spent his life growing, working, and learning on his family’s farm.  His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.
With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public.

Wanting to prove that he can be a hero in real life and not just on the pages of her books, Alan sets off to rescue her. Thrust into an epic jungle adventure, the unlikely pair will need to work together to survive the elements and find the ancient treasure before it’s lost forever.

Introducing my brand new Audi S1 e-tron quattro Hoonitron! Brian and I take a quick trip to Audi’s Design Center in Ingolstadt, Germany to see my 1 of 1 Gymkhana Prototype. It's wild that Audi was able to condense a one year build process from the drawing boards to reality in only four weeks! The all-electric Hoonitron is essentially a fully modernized version of one of my favorite race cars, the legendary Group B Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2, so I'm extremely excited for this. All that's left now is to patiently wait for my opportunity to Hoon it.
