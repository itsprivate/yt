Team RAR just busted 100 SUPERHERO MYTHS in 24 Hours (https://youtu.be/iurmE2h2r7U) but today we have some unsettling news: someone has broken into the Team RAR Mansion and destroyed the World's Tallest Trampoline Tower!!! Carder Sharer was first notified by Matt Braeden who noticed the tower was knocked over. It has been raining all week in LA and whoever did this must have used the rain as a cover to get away with it. The world's tallest trampoline stack with 11 trampolines and 300 feet high is now demolished. Unfortunately @Ryan Prunty didn't see it happen and @Hunter Kowald and Andrew were out of town. Everyone has filmed with this trampoline tower from @David Dobrik, @Drew Dirksen, @Bryce Hall, @Jordan Matter, @Unspeakable, @Ben Azelart and @Tanner Braungardt  have all been to the Team RAR house to film with it and now it's gone?! Cops were definitely called for this one and I WILL catch whoever did this. Who do you think did it?? Comment below!!

My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!

This speedrun uses the Mugman duplication glitch. By bounding both player 1 and player 2 to the same controller, we can spawn extra Mugman clones. This is done by removing player 2, and immediately adding it back. The glitch allows us to defeat bosses extremely quickly, which makes it perfect for speedrunning.

80+ recipes
140+ lifelike ingredients
Perks and skills to unlock

Your kitchen‚Äôs got all the gear a chef might need. Griddles, cookers, gas stands, ovens and tons of utensils like pots, pans, plates, knives, spatulas and blenders! We made sure that you can freely interact with all this stuff using your VR hands. On top of that there are over 140 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. There‚Äôs also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour!

Lifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time you‚Äôre slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there is some real-life physics applied to it. Each product has a different resistance to the knife and you can feel it through haptic feedback of your VR controllers.
Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you‚Äôll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.

Career mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant. You‚Äôll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you‚Äôll be able to unlock various perks and skills.

However, if you‚Äôre not interested in playing by the rules, you‚Äôre going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don‚Äôt even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Use a slow-motion button to cut veggies in the air, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/CfB3ll3oQs8</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/CfB3ll3oQs8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 02:51:26 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Thanks again to Amazon Prime Video for sponsoring!

When Marines arrived in Port Everglades for Fleet Week, the local sheriff informed them that there was a true war hero who lived nearby, and that he had a very particular problem the Marines might be able to help him with.

Captain Robert ‚ÄúWoody‚Äù Woodbury needed help with something that may sound small, but that was very important to him. He needed the old and worn American flag he had flying in his front yard replaced. 

Captain Woodbury could barely believe it when Marines from the Expeditionary Strike Group brought over a flag that had actually been flown on a US ship that very morning.

A portion of this video was premiered during the Streamys, so thank you so much to the Streamys for featuring us! You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg

Here is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I‚Äôve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own ‚Äî and though I‚Äôm not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??

Also, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day! Stay safe everyone!!

This video is NOT sponsored, but thanks to Kung Fu Tea & Megan for letting us film at your store!
