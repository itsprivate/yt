His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.

Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

LYRICS
Snow falls down from the gray sky 
Ashes fall in the sea 
Plans are thrown to the wayside 
Frozen days of the week 

But everybody wants to make it home this year 
Even if the world is crumbling down 
Cause everybody‚Äôs got somebody who‚Äôs got their name on a shelf 
With cheap d√©cor and flavored cheer 
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year 

Dust off old photo boxes 
This one‚Äôs marked ‚Äò92 
Years past seemed so much grander 
This one needs to come through 

Cause everybody wants to make it home this year 
Even if the world is crumbling down 
Cause everybody‚Äôs got somebody who‚Äôs got their name on a shelf 
With cheap d√©cor and flavored cheer 
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok "For You Page"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.

Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis | December 7, 2021
Stepping into a DMV when you're about to take your first driver's test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral "drivers license" (hence the DMV locale and its "interesting vibes.") Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and songwriting for the majority of her 18 years, as if she's been observing the right moves from the backseat of the car until it was time for her to get behind the wheel.

Rodrigo and her band take on the Tiny Desk mentality as they experiment with arrangements throughout this performance, embracing new sounds for her songs. The set begins with an acoustic version of the pop-punk-ish single "good 4 u," and a similar setup continues with the addition of an echoey, electric guitar in "traitor." "drivers license" features only Rodrigo and her keyboard, a shift from the recorded version well-known for Dan Nigro's production and the ever-present beeping of a car door sensor. "deja vu" starts softly with just an acoustic guitar until the chorus ramps up to a full band after she exclaims, "Do you get deja vu, huh?"

SOUR tells the story of a first heartbreak, one that inspires an intense anguish most accessible when you're a teenager. That open wound, empty-chest feeling of a breakup, especially when you're as young as Rodrigo, is difficult to shake. The album allowed listeners to bask in Rodrigo's heartache as if it were their own, but as she dances around an empty DMV and laughs along to a song about betrayal, she proves that time heals all wounds.

SET LIST
"good 4 u"
"traitor"
"drivers license"
"deja vu"

MUSICIANS
Olivia Rodrigo ‚Äì vocals, guitar, keys
Heather Baker - guitars
Hayley Brownell - drums, guitars

Introducing NPR Music&apos;s Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It&apos;s the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.

Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis | December 7, 2021
Stepping into a DMV when you&apos;re about to take your first driver&apos;s test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral &quot;drivers license&quot; (hence the DMV locale and its &quot;interesting vibes.&quot;) Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and songwriting for the majority of her 18 years, as if she&apos;s been observing the right moves from the backseat of the car until it was time for her to get behind the wheel.

Rodrigo and her band take on the Tiny Desk mentality as they experiment with arrangements throughout this performance, embracing new sounds for her songs. The set begins with an acoustic version of the pop-punk-ish single &quot;good 4 u,&quot; and a similar setup continues with the addition of an echoey, electric guitar in &quot;traitor.&quot; &quot;drivers license&quot; features only Rodrigo and her keyboard, a shift from the recorded version well-known for Dan Nigro&apos;s production and the ever-present beeping of a car door sensor. &quot;deja vu&quot; starts softly with just an acoustic guitar until the chorus ramps up to a full band after she exclaims, &quot;Do you get deja vu, huh?&quot;

SOUR tells the story of a first heartbreak, one that inspires an intense anguish most accessible when you&apos;re a teenager. That open wound, empty-chest feeling of a breakup, especially when you&apos;re as young as Rodrigo, is difficult to shake. The album allowed listeners to bask in Rodrigo&apos;s heartache as if it were their own, but as she dances around an empty DMV and laughs along to a song about betrayal, she proves that time heals all wounds.

üëë Letra  üëë

Dejen de meterse ya, en donde no les importa
Pi√©nsenla dos veces, antes de ir a abrir la boca 
Cada qui√©n que haga nom√°s lo que le toca 
Y menos broncas 
Mero 
Como hablan mal hasta de su familia 
Y no me imagino lo que dicen de la m√≠a 
Pero a m√≠ se me resbala lo que digan de mi vida 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
No se enreden, cada qui√©n 
Si les cala, nom√°s no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
¬°Ay ‚Äòapasito! 
¬°Apriete que nos pelaron, mijo! 
Y cada qui√©n haga con su vida lo que quiera 
¬øO no, Maluma?
¬°Ay ‚Äòap√°!
¬°Y puro Grupo Firme!
¬°M√°s firme que nunca! 
¬øPara qu√© preguntan cu√°nto gano y cu√°nto tengo? 
Nada m√°s me quieren andar contando el dinero 
Cada qui√©n trabaja pa‚Äô no estar pidiendo de lo ajeno 
Pierden nada m√°s, el tiempo cuando me critican 
Quieren verme abajo, y a subir, m√°s me motivan 
Cada qui√©n se tiene qu√© poner bien pilas 
Sin envidia 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¬°Cada qui√©n! 
No se enreden, cada qui√©n 
Si les cala, nom√°s no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¬°Cada qui√©n!

my 30-day online filmmaking & storytelling class just launched! Enrollment is open now until December 27.  the class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience, designed to teach you everything I know about filmmaking and storytelling, i'm going to share with you my entire creative process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I create 2 brand new movies from scratch... from how I come up the ideas, all the way through exporting the final videos.

over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 2 original, shareable films of your own.  its is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. I spent the past year working on it, and I'm extremely proud of the result. It's designed to level you up whether you're a beginner or a more experienced filmmaker.

The class officially starts on January 10, 2022, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested

(also In the video, I say it's $300, but it's actually $249)

From visionary filmmaker Lana Wachowski comes ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections,‚Äù the long-awaited next chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre. The new film reunites original stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the iconic roles they made famous, Neo and Trinity.

In ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections,‚Äù return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. And if Thomas‚Ä¶Neo‚Ä¶has learned anything, it‚Äôs that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of‚Äîor into‚Äî
the Matrix. Of course, Neo already knows what he has to do. But what he doesn‚Äôt yet know is the Matrix is stronger, more secure and more dangerous than ever before.  D√©j√† vu.

Reeves reprises the dual roles of Thomas Anderson/Neo, the man once saved from the Matrix to become the savior of humankind, who will once again have to choose which path to follow.
Moss portrays the iconic warrior Trinity‚Ä¶ or is she Tiffany, a suburban wife and mother of three with a penchant for superpowered motorcycles?

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (‚ÄúCandyman,‚Äù the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù franchise) plays the wise and worldly Morpheus who, as always, serves as a guide to Neo while also fulfilling his own greater purpose on a very singular journey of self-discovery.

Jessica Henwick (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúIron Fist,‚Äù ‚ÄúStar Wars: Episode VII ‚Äì The Force Awakens‚Äù) plays the hacker Bugs, the proverbial white rabbit on a mission to discover the one who sacrificed himself for humankind--and willing to take any risk necessary in search of the legend she idolizes.

Jonathan Groff (‚ÄúHamilton,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindhunter‚Äù), plays Thomas Anderson‚Äôs business partner, a slick, confident corporate type with insouciant charm, a disarming smile and an eye on the bottom line--everything Mr. Anderson is not.

Neil Patrick Harris (‚ÄúGone Girl‚Äù) plays Thomas‚Äô therapist, working closely with his patient to understand the meaning behind his dreams and to distinguish them from reality.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuantico‚Äù) plays a young woman with a wisdom that belies her years and an ability to see the truth, no matter how murky the waters.

And Jada Pinkett Smith (‚ÄúAngel Has Fallen,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù) returns as Niobe, the fierce General who once fought for the survival of Zion and who now sees to the welfare of her people with a familiar fire in her eyes, despite a sense of disbelief and suspicion upon Neo‚Äôs return.

Lana Wachowski directed from a screenplay by Wachowski & David Mitchell & Aleksandar Hemon, based on characters created by The Wachowskis. The film was produced by James McTeigue, Lana Wachowski and Grant Hill. The executive producers were Garrett Grant, Terry Needham, Michael Salven, Karin Wachowski, Jesse Ehrman and Bruce Berman.

Wachowski‚Äôs creative team behind the scenes included ‚ÄúSense8‚Äù collaborators: directors of photography Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll, production designers Hugh Bateup and Peter Walpole, editor Joseph Jett Sally, costume designer Lindsay Pugh, visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, and composers Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer.

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents, In Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, In Association with Venus Castina Productions, ‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections.‚Äù The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. It will be in theaters nationwide and on HBO Max via the Ad-Free plan on December 22, 2021; it will be available on HBO Max in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release.
‚ÄúThe Matrix Resurrections‚Äù is rated R for violence and some language.]]></description><link>https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/nNpvWBuTfrc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://youtube.buzzing.cc/youtube/nNpvWBuTfrc</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 22:37:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>Remember what is real.

There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my style. ‚ÄòPitbull‚Äô is always going to be on the attack,‚Äù said Cruz. ‚ÄúI think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.‚Äù
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis‚Äô ribs.
 
The 27-year-old Baltimore native turned on the power in the fourth, alternating between the right hook and left cross behind his southpaw stance. More punishing blows came from Davis during the fifth. 
 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a shorter fighter, so I was throwing down on the top of his head,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúI hit him with my knuckle and messed it up. I hurt my hand in the sixth round. No matter if the opponent is taller or shorter, I‚Äôve got to get through it. He‚Äôs a warrior. Even though he didn‚Äôt win, a star was born tonight.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIt was right around the fifth round I saw that his hand wasn‚Äôt working correctly,‚Äù Cruz observed. 
 
Davis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.
 
The 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight‚Äôs end. 
 
Naturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.
 
‚ÄúViva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,‚Äù he said.
 
Following a successful title defense, Davis said he‚Äôs ready for all comers.
 
‚ÄúL.A., we did it for Kobe,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the fight, he came on strong. I felt as the fight was going, he was breaking down. But I hurt my hand, so I wasn‚Äôt able to get him out of there.
 
‚ÄúWhatever the best opportunity is for me, I‚Äôll do it. All of them guys are easy work. I‚Äôm the top dog.‚Äù

There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my style. ‚ÄòPitbull‚Äô is always going to be on the attack,‚Äù said Cruz. ‚ÄúI think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.‚Äù
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis‚Äô ribs.
 
The 27-year-old Baltimore native turned on the power in the fourth, alternating between the right hook and left cross behind his southpaw stance. More punishing blows came from Davis during the fifth. 
 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a shorter fighter, so I was throwing down on the top of his head,‚Äù said Davis. ‚ÄúI hit him with my knuckle and messed it up. I hurt my hand in the sixth round. No matter if the opponent is taller or shorter, I‚Äôve got to get through it. He‚Äôs a warrior. Even though he didn‚Äôt win, a star was born tonight.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIt was right around the fifth round I saw that his hand wasn‚Äôt working correctly,‚Äù Cruz observed. 
 
Davis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.
 
The 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight‚Äôs end. 
 
Naturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.
 
‚ÄúViva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,‚Äù he said.

This is part 2 of my Halo Infinite Multiplayer review! Where I mostly talk about the positives and great innovations that 343i have made. Despite the lackluster content, Infinite is an exceptional Halo title. The foundation is laid and I can't wait to see what is built on top of it.
