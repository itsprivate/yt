Letra: 

¿Qué me hizo usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar…

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido, oh - oh

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Las ganas de tenerla
Yo no pude, tuve
Que Aceptarlo cuando me detuve, sudé
En la parte de atrás 
Aunque falta comodidad
Tus gritos confirmaron que has visto las nubes
La bellaquera nos domina 
Siempre que tu y yo nos vemos 
No importa el ambiente, donde sea nos comemos
No hay planificación 
Porque a ti la situación te descontrola 
Y no hay forma de evitar la situación 
Siempre terminamos sin ropa
No te conformas con un beso en la boca
Según tu dices, yo soy el que te provoca
Pero me buscas, aunque sabes que tengo a otra

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamos a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que marchar
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

La primera vez que perriamos
No pudimos evitarlo y nos besamos
Que el momento no acabara
No dejamo’ en vano
No fue, la toqué como un piano
Tu mirada me dijo que estoy gano
¿Mami, tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
Bebé, pues no se hable mas
No me sueltes y vámonos de una vez
Bendecido por ser el que ve tu desnudez
Lo mas que me gusta de ti es tu sencillez
Le gusta agresivo, pero que entre con delicadez
De la Metro a Mayagüez

¿Que me dice usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar….

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamos a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas

Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que marchar
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

La primera vez que perriamos
No pudimos evitarlo y nos besamos
Que el momento no acabara
No dejamo’ en vano
No fue, la toqué como un piano
Tu mirada me dijo que estoy gano
¿Mami, tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
Bebé, pues no se hable mas
No me sueltes y vámonos de una vez
Bendecido por ser el que ve tu desnudez
Lo mas que me gusta de ti es tu sencillez
Le gusta agresivo, pero que entre con delicadez
De la Metro a Mayagüez

¿Que me dice usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar….

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamos a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas

Lyrics:
Yo lo que ando es… 
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
 
Hey mujer… 
Happy Birthday!
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
Hey mujer
Happy Birthday! 
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
 
Donde están las Girlas
Bailando quiero verlas
Voy a hacerla mia
Y entretenerlas
 
En el 2022 los kilos se pasan por aplicaciones
Le dimos pa europa, los gringos están jodones
Del party privado, para el jet privado
Millonario amado, yo no soy Carrillo y soy el más amado
 
Llegamos a la disco y vieron los troces
La mami chula haciendo la poses! 
Esto es para ustedes para que se lo gocen
Pila de hookahs , pila de botella, llegaron los bosses
Yo soy Tempo, un placer ma
Si me ves en el VIP me puedes besar
Puedes venir donde mi y beber de gratis
Sabiendo que…
Yo soy tu mami, tu eres mi papi!
 
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos

Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
 
Hey mujer… 
Happy Birthday!
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
Hey mujer…
Happy Birthday! 
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes.
 
Donde están las Girlas
Bailando quiero verlas
Voy a hacerla mia
Y entretenerlas 
 
Si te digo que está menudo, las pacas son de 2mil
Si te digo está entero, paca verde de 100mil
1500 caballos la goma como un misil
Volando como un cohete, si disparo con fusil
 
Grabate bebe súbelo al ”TikTok”
Tu estás bien de to’
Y sabes que estás buena, (buena)
Buena la Dominicana, Colombiana y la Chilena
La calle está buena, se acabó la cuarentena
 
Vuelo con seguridad
Y los cueros con la tropa
15 años pegado, ni que vuele tu me topa
El valor de tu carrera yo lo gasto en una ropa
Si calcula la muñeca, hasta la vida te arropa

Every rivalry. Leads to this. Cobra Kai S4 premieres globally Dec 31, only on Netflix. 

COBRA KAI takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Season 4 finds the Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang dojos joining forces to take down Cobra Kai at the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament... and whoever loses must hang up their gi. As Samantha and Miguel try to maintain the dojo alliance and Robby goes all in at Cobra Kai, the fate of the Valley has never been more precarious. What tricks does Kreese have up his sleeve? Can Daniel and Johnny bury their decades-long hatchet to defeat Kreese? Or will Cobra Kai become the face of karate in the valley?

LYRICS
Snow falls down from the gray sky 
Ashes fall in the sea 
Plans are thrown to the wayside 
Frozen days of the week 

But everybody wants to make it home this year 
Even if the world is crumbling down 
Cause everybody’s got somebody who’s got their name on a shelf 
With cheap décor and flavored cheer 
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year 

Dust off old photo boxes 
This one’s marked ‘92 
Years past seemed so much grander 
This one needs to come through 

Cause everybody wants to make it home this year 
Even if the world is crumbling down 
Cause everybody’s got somebody who’s got their name on a shelf 
With cheap décor and flavored cheer 
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year

HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok "For You Page"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!
