George:  @GeorgeNotFound 
Sapnap:  @Sapnap 
Antfrost:  @Antfrost  
Awesamdude:  @awesamdude 

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are not FOUR hunters but FIVE instead of just one.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost AND my friend awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

Eladio Carrión - Jóvenes Millonarios Letra:
El draco o la uzi? 
Las dos 

Mi primera cubana fue gracias a la grama
Pila de marihuana pasa por aduana
Quieren ver mi cara en primera plana
De verme caer se quedaron con ganas
Solo quiero el toto ella quiere ohana 
Yo quiero los tríos en Copacabana
Se toca mientras la amiga lo mama 
Le cache unos pantys son Dolce & Gabbana
Yo tengo hermanos yo no tengo panas
Dicen que son bros pero como se mueven parecen hermanas
Ellos no son unos sapos es verdad son mas grandes que eso pa mi que son ranas
No quiero fama solo quiero un cheque porque si me toca irme mañana
Que mi mama pueda comprar un carro nuevo todos los fines de semana 
Josiando josiando, contando en el bando
Estoy multiplicando, mujeres tentando 
Los poli observando, los chotas hablando
Tengo un pal de haters se pasan tirando
Tienen ticket pero el talento pa cuando 
Si supieran que solo estoy calentando 
Sigo facturando ustedes comentando
Estoy viviendo lo que ustedes están soñando, yeh 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Si hay problemas le llega la manada 
Me preguntan, pero no digo nada 
Vivo la vida como si el mundo se acabara no se si amanezca mañana 
Siempre le suelto dinero a los tecos en el case ellos son locos con mi llegada
Si me tocas vas a bailar lambada 
Y no por la música sino por las balas 
Tengo gente que mata por mi 
También gente por la que doy la vida
Si suelto pal de pacas de mil, apuesto a que todos los tuyos se te viran 
Los miro a la cara y se les ve la envidia 
Dios mio que nunca se caigan las vias
Siempre lo mantengo gansteril 
Los mios hasta por correo la envían 
Millonario joven, no le falta na a abuela ni a la mother
Ahora quieren conmigo todas las top models
Ninguna va a hacer que yo me enamore, ey
Todo el que esta con los peines de tambores, si
Mando a los delanteros te meten goles 
Young Kingz baby

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios

Eladio Carrión - Jóvenes Millonarios Letra:
El draco o la uzi? 
Las dos 

Mi primera cubana fue gracias a la grama
Pila de marihuana pasa por aduana
Quieren ver mi cara en primera plana
De verme caer se quedaron con ganas
Solo quiero el toto ella quiere ohana 
Yo quiero los tríos en Copacabana
Se toca mientras la amiga lo mama 
Le cache unos pantys son Dolce &amp; Gabbana
Yo tengo hermanos yo no tengo panas
Dicen que son bros pero como se mueven parecen hermanas
Ellos no son unos sapos es verdad son mas grandes que eso pa mi que son ranas
No quiero fama solo quiero un cheque porque si me toca irme mañana
Que mi mama pueda comprar un carro nuevo todos los fines de semana 
Josiando josiando, contando en el bando
Estoy multiplicando, mujeres tentando 
Los poli observando, los chotas hablando
Tengo un pal de haters se pasan tirando
Tienen ticket pero el talento pa cuando 
Si supieran que solo estoy calentando 
Sigo facturando ustedes comentando
Estoy viviendo lo que ustedes están soñando, yeh 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Si hay problemas le llega la manada 
Me preguntan, pero no digo nada 
Vivo la vida como si el mundo se acabara no se si amanezca mañana 
Siempre le suelto dinero a los tecos en el case ellos son locos con mi llegada
Si me tocas vas a bailar lambada 
Y no por la música sino por las balas 
Tengo gente que mata por mi 
También gente por la que doy la vida
Si suelto pal de pacas de mil, apuesto a que todos los tuyos se te viran 
Los miro a la cara y se les ve la envidia 
Dios mio que nunca se caigan las vias
Siempre lo mantengo gansteril 
Los mios hasta por correo la envían 
Millonario joven, no le falta na a abuela ni a la mother
Ahora quieren conmigo todas las top models
Ninguna va a hacer que yo me enamore, ey
Todo el que esta con los peines de tambores, si
Mando a los delanteros te meten goles 
Young Kingz baby

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios 

Tengo pal de shooters a mi lao’ pal de sicarios 
Gente que muere y mata por mi tengo varios
Pero no los mando solo si es necesario
Jóvenes empresarios, jóvenes millonarios

Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It is an expression of culture, our parents' love and a means of celebration or comfort. That’s why it hits a special nerve when we are told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst press. It doesn’t help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us an answer! 

The reality is, well, it’s complicated. Let’s take a look at three climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what happens.

Filled with new life experience, two more Grammys than last year, and a few less of her infamous one-liners, Billie Eilish truly is happier than ever. From hosting the Met Gala to being the reason Oscar de la Renta no longer sells fur, watch to see how much Billie has grown since her first interview in 2017 with Vanity Fair.
