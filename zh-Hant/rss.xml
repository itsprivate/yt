More about Planet Coaster (from Steam):

Surprise, delight and thrill crowds as you build the theme park of your dreams. Build and design incredible coaster parks with unparalleled attention to detail and manage your park in a truly living world.

Piece-by-Piece Construction: Planet Coaster makes a designer out of everyone. Lay paths, build scenery, customize rides and make everything in your park unique with piece-by-piece construction and over a thousand unique building components.

Landscape Sculpting: Play with nature and reshape the land beneath your feet. Sculpt the landscape to raise mountains, form lakes, dig caverns and even build islands in the sky, then weave coasters through your park above ground and below.

Total Authenticity: Recreate your favorite rides or leave the real world at the door. However you love to play, the most realistic rides and most realistic reactions from your guests make Planet Coaster the most authentic simulation ever.

Simulation Evolved: The deepest park simulation in gaming history rewards your skills and makes management fun. Control every aspect of your guests’ experience and watch as Planet Coaster’s world reacts to your choices in an instant.

A Living World: Every park guest is an expressive individual who thinks, feels and explores your park with their own interests and desires. Together Planet Coaster’s guests will tell you at a glance just how well your park is run.

Park Management: You’re the boss with accessible controls that make management fun. Test your skills in a campaign of creative scenarios, or just build for fun and tweak your parks to surprise, delight and thrill your guests.

Communal Creation: Planet Coaster links coaster fanatics and creators around the world with the Steam Workshop community hub. Trade scenery, rollercoasters and even entire parks with other players, and add the world’s wildest creations to your own park.

Be Inspired: Discover new content from the world’s best coaster park creators every day. Browse and download content from your favorite creators, or choose from the latest designs selected by the Planet Coaster dev team.

Share Your Creativity: Whether it’s a magnificent ice cream shop or the world’s most thrilling coaster, build it, name it and share it with the planet. Join a community of creators and see your designs appear in parks around the world.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[試着讓人們在沒有食譜的情況下製作香腸]]></title><description><![CDATA[Get ready to get stuffed!

Lyrics:
God is Great

Outlawz

[Hook]
You hold the gun I take the wheel
If you say go you know I will
And though this love has its flaw
We’re forever outlaws
You Messed around but I forgave ya
Why do they still want me to hate ya
Cause if im choosing to forget it
Why cant they just mind they business
Cause I’m stuck, stuck like glue
Cause I can’t I can’t I can’t stop lovin you

I wanna see my dawgs on the mountain tops
Them niggas only ballin when they album drop
I gotta line of cars wrap around the block
And living better than these rappers rappin around the clock 
I built a golf course and a car porch 
since everybody askin where your cars going
Mozzarella now its only tall cheddar
Most dope boys been a Paul bearer 
Package the product then you pick it up at the Bahamas
 Talkin them dollars how I touch it Come off as a profit
You leave ya pistol home then you on ya own 
Cause lil one when its on they gon do ya wrong
See you nodding off on that fentanyl 
If you not a boss boy don’t get involved (On God)

[Hook]

Life full of VVS Diamonds and bad choices
Young nigga dreaming bout tech nines and porches
It’s cold I keep my hoodie on
Glock 4-5 ready to get my boogie on
You pussy niggas panties showin’
My bitch say I talk in my sleep
I start park drive and put it in reverse wit my heat
Pistol taklkin back I think I heard it cursin at me
It say you better not fuck a bitch or write a verse without me (on God)
The streets left me scared nigga I’m bleedin but its concrete showing
So the karma don’t catch up wit me I keep going
Better come and get ya bitch cause she going (she on go)
this that straight drop straight drop 
All these other niggas rerock
Call my nine Jada she kissin’ nigga d-block
Know some nigga out on the west they reppin tree top
These niggas still talkin like bitches I pray that shit stop
Ion wanna here ya opinion about whats hip hop 
30 hanging off of my bridges nigga that’s hip-hop (On God) 

[Hook]

They callin it Pandemic when  it’s really life
The only way to separate the men and mice
Until you seen success you considered roguish 
That’s why you see that nigga pull up in a lotus
He got the 40 on him up against his colon 
Standin in the club and know them niggas rollin
We all gotta purpose and my people servin
All got some work in and I’m speaking murders
Still be countin funds until my fingers purple 
Praying for ya mother but’ll still hurt ya
Smokin on a bag that I got from Berner 
The bottles all black and that bitch a earner
Soldiers waving flags when they see the colonel
If you see the flash, then it don’t concern ya (on God)

Letra: 

¿Qué me hizo usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar…

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido, oh - oh

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamo’ a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

Las ganas de tenerla
Yo no pude, tuve
Que Aceptarlo cuando me detuve, sudé
En la parte de atrás 
Aunque falta comodidad
Tus gritos confirmaron que has visto las nubes
La bellaquera nos domina 
Siempre que tu y yo nos vemos 
No importa el ambiente, donde sea nos comemos
No hay planificación 
Porque a ti la situación te descontrola 
Y no hay forma de evitar la situación 
Siempre terminamos sin ropa
No te conformas con un beso en la boca
Según tu dices, yo soy el que te provoca
Pero me buscas, aunque sabes que tengo a otra

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamos a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que marchar
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas 

La primera vez que perriamos
No pudimos evitarlo y nos besamos
Que el momento no acabara
No dejamo’ en vano
No fue, la toqué como un piano
Tu mirada me dijo que estoy gano
¿Mami, tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
¿Tu quieres mas?
Bebé, pues no se hable mas
No me sueltes y vámonos de una vez
Bendecido por ser el que ve tu desnudez
Lo mas que me gusta de ti es tu sencillez
Le gusta agresivo, pero que entre con delicadez
De la Metro a Mayagüez

¿Que me dice usted?
Que la quiero Volver a ver
Y volverla a besar
Yo te paso a buscar, buscar….

Es que la bellaquera contigo
Con nadie mas la consigo
De tus gritos no me olvido

Tengo reservado el hotel,
Pero con estas ganas no vamos a llegar
Somos dos desesperados por eso nos tuvimos que parkear
Atras nos espera el asiento
Tu eres una Aventura
Cuando te desnudas

Lyrics:
Yo lo que ando es… 
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
 
Hey mujer… 
Happy Birthday!
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
Hey mujer
Happy Birthday! 
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
 
Donde están las Girlas
Bailando quiero verlas
Voy a hacerla mia
Y entretenerlas
 
En el 2022 los kilos se pasan por aplicaciones
Le dimos pa europa, los gringos están jodones
Del party privado, para el jet privado
Millonario amado, yo no soy Carrillo y soy el más amado
 
Llegamos a la disco y vieron los troces
La mami chula haciendo la poses! 
Esto es para ustedes para que se lo gocen
Pila de hookahs , pila de botella, llegaron los bosses
Yo soy Tempo, un placer ma
Si me ves en el VIP me puedes besar
Puedes venir donde mi y beber de gratis
Sabiendo que…
Yo soy tu mami, tu eres mi papi!
 
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Moviendo los kilos y los culos
Que levante la mano los que tengan to’
 
Hey mujer… 
Happy Birthday!
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes
Hey mujer…
Happy Birthday! 
Llego a darte el de los ojos verdes.
 
Donde están las Girlas
Bailando quiero verlas
Voy a hacerla mia
Y entretenerlas 
 
Si te digo que está menudo, las pacas son de 2mil
Si te digo está entero, paca verde de 100mil
1500 caballos la goma como un misil
Volando como un cohete, si disparo con fusil
 
Grabate bebe súbelo al ”TikTok”
Tu estás bien de to’
Y sabes que estás buena, (buena)
Buena la Dominicana, Colombiana y la Chilena
La calle está buena, se acabó la cuarentena
 
Vuelo con seguridad
Y los cueros con la tropa
15 años pegado, ni que vuele tu me topa
El valor de tu carrera yo lo gasto en una ropa
Si calcula la muñeca, hasta la vida te arropa
 
Moviendo los kilos y los culos

Every rivalry. Leads to this. Cobra Kai S4 premieres globally Dec 31, only on Netflix. 

COBRA KAI takes place over 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Season 4 finds the Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang dojos joining forces to take down Cobra Kai at the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament... and whoever loses must hang up their gi. As Samantha and Miguel try to maintain the dojo alliance and Robby goes all in at Cobra Kai, the fate of the Valley has never been more precarious. What tricks does Kreese have up his sleeve? Can Daniel and Johnny bury their decades-long hatchet to defeat Kreese? Or will Cobra Kai become the face of karate in the valley?
