HELLO FRIENDS!! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok "For You Page"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite?? What ads do you get on TikTok?

Thanks to Kayley Melissa for helping me curl my hair!

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis | December 7, 2021
Stepping into a DMV when you're about to take your first driver's test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral "drivers license" (hence the DMV locale and its "interesting vibes.") Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and songwriting for the majority of her 18 years, as if she's been observing the right moves from the backseat of the car until it was time for her to get behind the wheel.

Rodrigo and her band take on the Tiny Desk mentality as they experiment with arrangements throughout this performance, embracing new sounds for her songs. The set begins with an acoustic version of the pop-punk-ish single "good 4 u," and a similar setup continues with the addition of an echoey, electric guitar in "traitor." "drivers license" features only Rodrigo and her keyboard, a shift from the recorded version well-known for Dan Nigro's production and the ever-present beeping of a car door sensor. "deja vu" starts softly with just an acoustic guitar until the chorus ramps up to a full band after she exclaims, "Do you get deja vu, huh?"

SOUR tells the story of a first heartbreak, one that inspires an intense anguish most accessible when you're a teenager. That open wound, empty-chest feeling of a breakup, especially when you're as young as Rodrigo, is difficult to shake. The album allowed listeners to bask in Rodrigo's heartache as if it were their own, but as she dances around an empty DMV and laughs along to a song about betrayal, she proves that time heals all wounds.

#GRUPOFIRME #MALUMA

👑 Letra  👑

Dejen de meterse ya, en donde no les importa
Piénsenla dos veces, antes de ir a abrir la boca 
Cada quién que haga nomás lo que le toca 
Y menos broncas 
Mero 
Como hablan mal hasta de su familia 
Y no me imagino lo que dicen de la mía 
Pero a mí se me resbala lo que digan de mi vida 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Cada quién! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¡Cada quién! 
No se enreden, cada quién 
Si les cala, nomás no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Ay ‘apasito! 
¡Apriete que nos pelaron, mijo! 
Y cada quién haga con su vida lo que quiera 
¿O no, Maluma?
¡Ay ‘apá!
¡Y puro Grupo Firme!
¡Más firme que nunca! 
¿Para qué preguntan cuánto gano y cuánto tengo? 
Nada más me quieren andar contando el dinero 
Cada quién trabaja pa’ no estar pidiendo de lo ajeno 
Pierden nada más, el tiempo cuando me critican 
Quieren verme abajo, y a subir, más me motivan 
Cada quién se tiene qué poner bien pilas 
Sin envidia 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Cada quién! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¡Cada quién! 
No se enreden, cada quién 
Si les cala, nomás no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¡Cada quién!

#GRUPOFIRME #MALUMA

👑 Letra  👑

Dejen de meterse ya, en donde no les importa
Piénsenla dos veces, antes de ir a abrir la boca 
Cada quién que haga nomás lo que le toca 
Y menos broncas 
Mero 
Como hablan mal hasta de su familia 
Y no me imagino lo que dicen de la mía 
Pero a mí se me resbala lo que digan de mi vida 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Cada quién! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¡Cada quién! 
No se enreden, cada quién 
Si les cala, nomás no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Ay ‘apasito! 
¡Apriete que nos pelaron, mijo! 
Y cada quién haga con su vida lo que quiera 
¿O no, Maluma?
¡Ay ‘apá!
¡Y puro Grupo Firme!
¡Más firme que nunca! 
¿Para qué preguntan cuánto gano y cuánto tengo? 
Nada más me quieren andar contando el dinero 
Cada quién trabaja pa’ no estar pidiendo de lo ajeno 
Pierden nada más, el tiempo cuando me critican 
Quieren verme abajo, y a subir, más me motivan 
Cada quién se tiene qué poner bien pilas 
Sin envidia 
Y si tomo casi toda la semana 
Y si diario me quiero jalar la banda 
¡Cada quién! 
¡Cada quién! 
Que si me gasto el dinero en cosas caras 
Si me voy de vacaciones para Italia 
¡Cada quién! 
No se enreden, cada quién 
Si les cala, nomás no volteen a ver 
Y si otra vez me quiero amanecer 
¡Cada quién!

Watch the new trailer for The Matrix Resurrections now – in theaters and on HBO Max 12.22.21. Get tickets: https://gettickets.whatisthematrix.com #MatrixMonday #TheMatrix 

-----------------
https://www.facebook.com/TheMatrixMovie/

-----------------

From visionary filmmaker Lana Wachowski comes “The Matrix Resurrections,” the long-awaited next chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre. The new film reunites original stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the iconic roles they made famous, Neo and Trinity.

In “The Matrix Resurrections,” return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. And if Thomas…Neo…has learned anything, it’s that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of—or into—
the Matrix. Of course, Neo already knows what he has to do. But what he doesn’t yet know is the Matrix is stronger, more secure and more dangerous than ever before.  Déjà vu.

Reeves reprises the dual roles of Thomas Anderson/Neo, the man once saved from the Matrix to become the savior of humankind, who will once again have to choose which path to follow.
Moss portrays the iconic warrior Trinity… or is she Tiffany, a suburban wife and mother of three with a penchant for superpowered motorcycles?

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (“Candyman,” the “Aquaman” franchise) plays the wise and worldly Morpheus who, as always, serves as a guide to Neo while also fulfilling his own greater purpose on a very singular journey of self-discovery.

Jessica Henwick (TV’s “Iron Fist,” “Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens”) plays the hacker Bugs, the proverbial white rabbit on a mission to discover the one who sacrificed himself for humankind--and willing to take any risk necessary in search of the legend she idolizes.

Jonathan Groff (“Hamilton,” TV’s “Mindhunter”), plays Thomas Anderson’s business partner, a slick, confident corporate type with insouciant charm, a disarming smile and an eye on the bottom line--everything Mr. Anderson is not.

Neil Patrick Harris (“Gone Girl”) plays Thomas’ therapist, working closely with his patient to understand the meaning behind his dreams and to distinguish them from reality.

Priyanka Chopra Jonas (TV’s “Quantico”) plays a young woman with a wisdom that belies her years and an ability to see the truth, no matter how murky the waters.

And Jada Pinkett Smith (“Angel Has Fallen,” TV’s “Gotham”) returns as Niobe, the fierce General who once fought for the survival of Zion and who now sees to the welfare of her people with a familiar fire in her eyes, despite a sense of disbelief and suspicion upon Neo’s return.

Lana Wachowski directed from a screenplay by Wachowski & David Mitchell & Aleksandar Hemon, based on characters created by The Wachowskis. The film was produced by James McTeigue, Lana Wachowski and Grant Hill. The executive producers were Garrett Grant, Terry Needham, Michael Salven, Karin Wachowski, Jesse Ehrman and Bruce Berman.

Wachowski’s creative team behind the scenes included “Sense8” collaborators: directors of photography Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll, production designers Hugh Bateup and Peter Walpole, editor Joseph Jett Sally, costume designer Lindsay Pugh, visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, and composers Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer.

From visionary filmmaker Lana Wachowski comes “The Matrix Resurrections,” the long-awaited next chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre. The new film reunites original stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the iconic roles they made famous, Neo and Trinity.

In “The Matrix Resurrections,” return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. And if Thomas…Neo…has learned anything, it’s that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of—or into—
the Matrix. Of course, Neo already knows what he has to do. But what he doesn’t yet know is the Matrix is stronger, more secure and more dangerous than ever before.  Déjà vu.

Reeves reprises the dual roles of Thomas Anderson/Neo, the man once saved from the Matrix to become the savior of humankind, who will once again have to choose which path to follow.

There was no feeling-out process in the first. Cruz charged at the defending champion, pinning him against the ropes and wailing away. 
 
“That’s my style. ‘Pitbull’ is always going to be on the attack,” said Cruz. “I think we retained rhythm from the start to the end.”
 
Davis found his rhythm in the second and third, circling the ring and walking Cruz into shots. In the fourth, Cruz concentrated his attack on the body, pounding Davis’ ribs.
 
The 27-year-old Baltimore native turned on the power in the fourth, alternating between the right hook and left cross behind his southpaw stance. More punishing blows came from Davis during the fifth. 
 
“He’s a shorter fighter, so I was throwing down on the top of his head,” said Davis. “I hit him with my knuckle and messed it up. I hurt my hand in the sixth round. No matter if the opponent is taller or shorter, I’ve got to get through it. He’s a warrior. Even though he didn’t win, a star was born tonight.”
 
“It was right around the fifth round I saw that his hand wasn’t working correctly,” Cruz observed. 
 
Davis boxed beautifully in the middle rounds, firing quick shots and pivoting away from the return fire. A right hook in the eighth briefly buzzed Cruz and brought the audience to their feet. But just when it appeared as if the fight was slipping away, Cruz fought fire with fire, landing a flush uppercut seconds before the bell.
 
The 23-year-old Mexican picked up the pace in the latter rounds, keeping Davis on his toes and pounding away. Davis held his own, fighting back on even terms until the fight’s end. 
 
Naturally, Cruz believed he deserved the victory.
 
“Viva Mexico. I have nothing to say, the fans are speaking on who won this fight,” he said.
 
Following a successful title defense, Davis said he’s ready for all comers.
 
“L.A., we did it for Kobe,” said Davis. “At the beginning of the fight, he came on strong. I felt as the fight was going, he was breaking down. But I hurt my hand, so I wasn’t able to get him out of there.
 
“Whatever the best opportunity is for me, I’ll do it. All of them guys are easy work. I’m the top dog.”

Fazbear and Friends is an animated series based on the main cast of "Five Nights at Freddy's". The show follows the wacky misadventures of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and their many friends as they get themselves into trouble while trying to manage their pizzeria.

Will I be Solving my Friend's Impossible Minecraft Puzzle...

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. 

Thanks to @Vort3xDragon for making the scavenger hunt, this was epic!
