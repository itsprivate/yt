I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube for the Beem Team. I've built giant cereal bowls, IRL Spongebob's house, and even a giant Squid Game robot doll for MrBeast. But I've never made anything from Epic Games Fortnite. To change that, I built a custom Battle Royal Battle Bus and surprised many of the top Fortnite YouTubers with it! This video had lots of ups and downs including learning how to drive a bus, but we figured it all out, it turned out incredible, and we drove it to California to surprise Tiko and FaZe H1ghSky1. Their reaction were incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

If you’re reading this you’re a real one! 
Comment “Fortnite Chapter 3!" so I can notice you!

Alright so in this video I made some custom minecraft bosses and got a real mod developer to react to/review my designs. I ended up making bosses for the amethyst geodes, mountains, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we're working on some big things! My mental health is on an unbelievably sharp decline, so I don’t know when I will be back, but I love making videos so I won’t be gone forever

Alright so in this video I made some custom minecraft bosses and got a real mod developer to react to/review my designs. I ended up making bosses for the amethyst geodes, mountains, and nether biomes. They turned out really good! Sorry this video took so long to come out, we&apos;re working on some big things! My mental health is on an unbelievably sharp decline, so I don’t know when I will be back, but I love making videos so I won’t be gone forever

LYRICS
We the best music (Another one)
All hail to the queen, Mary J. Blige (Mary J. Blige)

It's so hard to fake when everything I do is real
Money and a doggie bag, I ain't missin' no meals
Don't move on me wrong, I need to save my energy
Everybody family leave it to the industry
Cut out all of that noise, we ain't talkin' that way
We ain't movin' like that, no way, no way
Cut out all that noise, only positive vibes
I don't it pay no mind, I don't pay it no mind (No mind)

Every day like my birthday, bring the cake in
Bring the cake in, bring the cake in
I feel good, I feel great, man, I feel amazing
Man, I feel amazing, man, I feel amazing
Every day cеlebrate, not just on occasion
On occasion, not just on occasion
I feel good, I feel great, man, I feel amazing
Feel amazing, man, I feel amazing

My crib is so big I tеll the guests to use a map
He wanna play house, I ask him, "Where's the fun in that?" (Let's go)
Seein' all these blessings, man, I think I pray too much
Lately, I been feeling like I turn up way too much

Where the drink? Where the drink? Sun got us all day
Raise the glasses up, party, party
Man, it's really goin' down
Make your way to the crowd
Right now, right now
Right now, right now

I feel too wavy, you can't save me
I meditate on the daily to keep sane
I mean, I'm goin' out my mind, I'm goin' crazy
I think it might be my season, I'm elevated, ayy

Every day like my birthday, bring the cake in
Bring the cake in, bring the cake in
I feel good, I feel great, man, I feel amazing
Man, I feel amazing, man, I feel amazing
Every day celebrate, not just on occasion
On occasion, not just on occasion
I feel good, I feel great, man, I feel amazing
Feel amazing, man, I feel amazing

Pick up everybody in the dance right now
If you feelin' amazin' like we feelin' amazing right now
Put your lighters up
Lights up, lighters up, let's go

Every day like my birthday, bring the cake in
Bring the cake in, bring the cake in
I feel good, I feel great, man, I feel amazing
Man, I feel amazing, man, I feel amazing
Every day celebrate, not just on occasion
On occasion, not just on occasion

Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach description (from Steam):

THE NEXT CHAPTER IN FEAR

Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe. Play as Gregory, a young boy trapped overnight in Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex. With the help of Freddy Fazbear himself, Gregory must survive the near-unstoppable hunt of reimagined Five Nights at Freddy’s characters - as well as new, horrific threats.

THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED - Once nighttime protocols are initiated, the animatronics at Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex will relentlessly pursue all intruders. Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Montgomery Gator, and the Pizzaplex’s security guard, Vanessa, will turn over every Cotton Candy Pizza Stand if they have to - it’s not wise to stay in one place for too long.

ADAPT TO SURVIVE - Access the building’s security cameras to survey the environment and plan your route through danger. Distract enemies by knocking over paint cans and toys - just slip away before enemies are drawn to your location. Hop into hiding spots and allow danger to pass, or try to outrun your pursuers. Play your way, but be prepared to adapt.

EXPLORE AND DISCOVER - Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex offers a variety of attractions for guests to enjoy - Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway, Bonnie Bowl, the sewers, and… Sewers? The Pizzaplex is vast and has no shortage of goodies to discover.
