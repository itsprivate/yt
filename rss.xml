Introducing my brand new Audi S1 e-tron quattro Hoonitron! Brian and I take a quick trip to Audi’s Design Center in Ingolstadt, Germany to see my 1 of 1 Gymkhana Prototype. It's wild that Audi was able to condense a one year build process from the drawing boards to reality in only four weeks! The all-electric Hoonitron is essentially a fully modernized version of one of my favorite race cars, the legendary Group B Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2, so I'm extremely excited for this. All that's left now is to patiently wait for my opportunity to Hoon it.

This series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.

Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.

The Universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the universe seems empty. Devoid of others. This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.

Confronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone watching but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty. Maybe it’s full of civilizations but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi paradox.

If you want to learn the design fundamentals it takes to make something like the Glitter Bomb, enroll in my Creative Engineering course at https://Monthly.com/MarkRober and I'll see you in class!

Get the new Glitterbomb 4.0 tshirt here- https://markrober.store/products/glitterbomb-4-0-pop-art-graphic-tee

A big shout out to Protolabs for the quick-turn machined parts. If you need some dope parts made fast, check out more about digital manufacturing right here: https://tinyurl.com/y6tunxv8

Behinds the scenes look at how we filmed the parody Apple commercial bit using the SISU Robotic Arm at Bubba's LA- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIdh7hxz1G8

The dog feeder kickstarter project made in my class is called Houndsy :) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/houndsy/houndsy-kibble-dispenser

Why are some faces blurred but not others? 
I default to blurring all faces (assuming it’s clear enough you can tell who they are) unless we have permission to not blur. 

More about my Creative Engineering class: This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life. During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life. The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own. This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer. The class officially starts in early Jan, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested! See you in class! Love, Mark

NANLUX's lights were instrumental for filming with the robotic arm:
