Zach Johnson, the “Millennial Farmer” is a 5th-generation farmer who’s spent his life growing, working, and learning on his family’s farm.  His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.
With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public.

Introducing my brand new Audi S1 e-tron quattro Hoonitron! Brian and I take a quick trip to Audi’s Design Center in Ingolstadt, Germany to see my 1 of 1 Gymkhana Prototype. It's wild that Audi was able to condense a one year build process from the drawing boards to reality in only four weeks! The all-electric Hoonitron is essentially a fully modernized version of one of my favorite race cars, the legendary Group B Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2, so I'm extremely excited for this. All that's left now is to patiently wait for my opportunity to Hoon it.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
This series is inspired by Wadzee and Luke TheNoteable Hardcore Minecraft Series, as well as Mumbo Jumbo and Grian on the Hermitcraft server. However, instead of it being Wadzee, Luke, Mumbo Jumbo or Grian, it's actually just sandiction, POG. I like to make Giant Mega Builds, and this is similar to a Custom Minecraft Challenge video, except the Custom Minecraft Challenge is to survive. You could call this Minecraft, But Hardcore.
